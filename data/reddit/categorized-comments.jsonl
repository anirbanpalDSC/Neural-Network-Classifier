The athletes the NFL are also bigger, stronger, and faster compared to 30 years ago. \n\n- Yes the NFC was stacked with the Bears, Redskins, and Giants at the time. The 49ers were also stacked every single season. These Patriots teams aren't stacked squads full of Pro Bowl level talent. At least not recently, and almost always never on offense. Brady has been doing this with guys on offense over 16 years that are going to be largely forgotten down the line. He's had a zillion running backs, receivers, and offensive linemen. The era of free agency has eliminated stacked teams for everyone. Despite this hurdle, Brady and the Patriots continue to roll. \n\n- Brady has been more durable in his career. He's a lot bigger than Montana ever was and hasn't been as injury prone. \n\n- The 49ers of the 80's weren't squeaky clean. Walsh was criticized for doing things like faking his coaches' headsets going out. Jerry Rice used stick-em. Montana recently admitted his offensive linemen used silicon spray until they got caught.

Lynch has essentially three options: stopgap veteran, trade for promising young backup, and/or Kirk Cousins.\n\nOption A: stopgap veterans are mostly mediocre talent like Hoyer and Kap who are just a warm body to prevent the fans from rioting while you tank for someone like Darnold. The exception to this is Romo, but he's not coming here. Who knows they may play amazing in Shanahan's system but they are not the end goal.\n\nOption B: this is where it gets interesting. You have guys like Jimmy G, AJ McCarron, Brett Hundley, and Mike Glennon who may have more untapped potential than the QBs in the draft. I personally think sports media and fans have very little idea of how GMs and coaches view these guys. According to Schefter, Glennon is expected to get 10-15 million a year. If you went \"what the fuck\", then yeah most of us do not know much about the value of these guys. That being said, the trade value for these guys is way less than someone like Cousins and maybe even the top 3 QBs in this draft, but the availability may not be there as their teams may value them more than their current market value.\n\nOption C: Bet the farm on Cousins."}

Before someone else jumps on me regarding this statement, yes, I know we're flush with cap space. The dude is just not worth it. But instead of trading him for Kendricks, I'd rather roll the dice on a draft pick. If we could get a 4th or 5th for him, I'd do it. This draft is deep with RBs (not that this is an immediate need) and defense. It won't guarantee that we're getting a decent player, but it'd be more cost efficient and allow us to develop someone who might be good when we start to get good rather than keeping an overpriced player who will be trending down by the time we get good.  \n&amp;nbsp;  \nMy main question is whether Kendricks is enough of an upgrade over our current ILBs to be worth trading for.

For the first 2 and a half quarters, the Falcons were putting on a clinic for how to stop the Brady Bellichik offense.

{"cat": "sports", "txt": "I've had enough of QBs who can't throw the damn ball with any kind of accuracy playing for this team."}
{"cat": "sports", "txt": "Today most of the time defenses use nickle packages for something like half of their snaps, that is a defense consists of six players who are primarily run defenders, defensive lineman and linebackers, and five players that are primarily pass defenders, safeties and corner backs. It is probably better to think about these roles as, who is the quickest guy they can cover and who is the largest guy they can block. If you put the emphasis on holding their own against every blocker, then they are run defenders. \n\nSo there are usually six players whose job is primarily to stop the run, these come in two categories, linebackers and lineman, it is usually said, that a lineman lines up in a three point stand, while a line backer lines up standing up. That is sort of useful but for purpose of this discussion, I will claim that a linebacker is someone who can cover at least some of the receivers some of the time. (Note that you can back paddle if you are standing up, but you can only start forward if you have a hand in the dirt.) Roughly a coach is comfortable to call a defense were the linebacker has to cover a tight end or a full back. \n\nThe discussion about 3-4 or 4-3 is about the base package, which is only used nowadays in obvious run situations. It is called \"base\" because twenty years ago most offenses did use \"pro personal\" most of the time, two running backs and a tight end, while today most of the time people use three wide receivers and only one running back. In a run situation, you take out one pass defender and put in a run defender, now you have a front-7 and four pass defenders and the question is, where do you put the additional run defender, if you put him on the line, then you are running a 3-4 defense, if you put him into the back field, then you are running a 4-3. The naming is just the wrong way round, the outside linebackers in a 3-4 are more similar to lineman in that they line up at the line of scrimmage, however they are called linebackers because one of them may have to cover the tight end if you are rushing 4 on a passing play. \n\nIn a 3-4 the lineman you put in is the nose tackle, who lines up just across the center. His job is, to exploit the half second the center needs to snap the ball, to attack him while he is not set and to push him backwards. Offensive coordinators, quarterbacks and centers know that he has that job, and they really don't like the idea. So they call blocking assignments were a guard helps the center. Now the nose tackle faces two offensive lineman, an inherently loosing proposition, however just counting there are 9 offensive players not occupied by the NT, but 10 defenders not the NT. So the idea is, that if the NT does not loose too badly, then the defense has suddenly a numbers advantage. By contrast, if you put an additional linebacker into your formation, then you loose less against the pass but someone has to deal with the lineman not occupied by the NT. So you gain some more flexibility, but you are also not forcing the offense to deal with an NT. \n\nA football defense consists of many moving parts and all of the above is only a first look. In particular if you start to draw alignments, you will see that a 3-4 defense lends itself a bit better towards a two gap scheme, that means that a defensive lineman has to defend both sides of an offensive lineman, he has to stop a running play were the back  is going either on the left or right side of the offensive lineman. By contrast a 4-3 defense lends itself better to a one gap scheme, the defensive lineman is only responsible for the gap between the center and the guard and only for that single gap. (But notice, the defensive coordinator can tell a linebacker that he is responsible for a gap in a 3-4 scheme, so that the lineman has only 1 gap responsibility.) The difference is largely, that in a 1 gap scheme the lineman can play more aggressive, he can just shoot into his assigned gap wether it is a run play or a pass play, while in a two gap scheme the defensive lineman has to read the offense first and then decide if he wants to defend the run or rush the passer. \n\nSo there are quite a few differences, but even after the decision of an 3-4 or 4-3 the defensive coordinator has still many options to adjust the specific personal, the game situation and crucially the categories are somewhat fluid. The best example is probably the fire-zone, that is a blitz were a lineman  drops into coverage to complicate the blocking assignments of the offensive line and the reads of the QB. And crucially both defenses can be successful, Denver and Seattle play 4-3 while the Pats use a hybrid front and the Steelers a 3-4. It is however important for player selection, what one wants to do most of the time, with 3-4 you want bigger lineman and generally players who read plays well, with a 4-3 you want more athletic lineman. And it is worth emphasizing again that most of the time the teams are in nickel packages, not in the base defense. \n\nAs for some further reading, the NYT (2010) had a nice series on defenses:\n\n[Guide to N.F.L.

I'm of the school of thought that says: build up the team some before getting your QB (unless there's some Manning like transcendent rookie). I see this working in Dallas, Oakland and even how Brady got his start. So giving a away a first round for a guy with a game and half of tape rubs me wrong. So while I agree with your points about AJ and Mike I don't need them to be permanent solutions at QB, just competent while the team gets their culture and system built. Plus if they're busts your only out a 3rd round. But then again there is a reason nobody has made me GM of a professional football team. ;-)"}

Are you in charge of the salary cap and contract negotiations? Will you oversee the scouting and college and pro personnel departments and will you have final say over the 53-man roster?**\n\n&gt;\u201cI think a lot of those things are specifics that we\u2019ve got to get to the point where the final strokes, I would say, as we get our head coach in order and all of those things. I can tell you that from the outset, what has been communicated to me is that we really want this to be a true partnership. Jed\u2019s communicated that. Paraag has communicated that. That\u2019s my wish.\n\n&gt;One of the great things, and I spoke earlier, and this doesn\u2019t ensure you success, but I can tell you, one thing from being a broadcaster, you get invited into people\u2019s buildings and like I said, this wasn\u2019t like I\u2019m sitting in there taking notes, stealing institutional knowledge. But, you do sit down with head coaches. You talk with management in the places you are. And I think the one common denominator that I\u2019ve seen when I talk to folks, in places where they have successful cultures and results, everyone\u2019s working in the same direction.\n\n&gt;In places that are inconsistent or are consistently poor franchises, you can see it because you can feel it because people from one side are coming up and saying, \u2018Hey, if I had any players, we could get this thing going.\u2019 Management is saying, \u2018Hey, if we had some guys coaching these guys.\u2019 That\u2019s not what we\u2019re going to be. We\u2019re going to strive to create a culture where everyone\u2019s working together.\n\n&gt;I think that\u2019s one of my strengths. It\u2019s something that I\u2019ve done throughout my career is I\u2019ve had an ability to bring people together. I\u2019ve been out front oftentimes. I\u2019ve been named captain. On a broadcast crew, you\u2019re out front and I think that\u2019s a strength of mine and whoever this head coach is going to be, that will be something that we all understand, that we\u2019re likeminded in our pursuit of winning a championship. Also, making a real positive impact in the community in which we play. Making our fans proud is something that we\u2019re going to be all about.\u201d\n\nSo a soft non-answer, but in his defense I think it's clarified in the rest of the conference call that:\n\n* He's avoiding some specifics because he just got hired and is steering away from potential tampering charges;\n* Paraag is still handling salaries/negotiation;\n* Gamble (mentioned by name as someone he wants to retain on staff) will be on personnel / scouting;\n* Lynch has control of the 90;\n* Lynch reports directly to Jed and not Paraag;\n* He's there to instill some sort of culture;\n* Kyle has final say on the 53\n\nSo kind of disingenuous for Cohn to zero in on his question and that specific response without the context of the rest of the call."}

Shannys system is difficult to comprehend and takes certain types of players to run it. Blocking tight ends who can catch, small quick o-lineman, route running WRs, all of these can be had later in the draft and in free agency.\n\nOur new defense takes freak athlete to run well."}

They realize that your collection of \"talent\" isn't going to make them scared any time soon. Your spot in the cellar of the NFC West has been secured.\nBut don't get it twisted: this isn't a total train wreck. Your team will most likely be bad in 2017, but Brad Kaaya should be able to get some starting reps by the end of the year. You've also saved your FA dollars and your draft picks, knowing that this will be a long rebuild. You're thinking long-term, and that shows the signs of a promising young GM, even if it doesn't translate to Ws right now.\ngrade: C+\n\n* Congratulations, you have fulfilled your mandated and filled your depth chart:\n1) Blaine Gabbert\n2) Jerod Evans\n3) Antonio Pipkin\nFA money spent: $5 million\nDraft picks spent: R2\nYou list Blaine Gabbert as the starting on your pre-season depth chart, but virtually no one in the front office or local papers even mentions his name. They all want to see what Jerod Evans can do in action, which may not be the best thing for this raw young QB's development. Chances are, you may have to rush him onto the field too early when Gabbert struggles, potentially endangering his confidence if he looks over his head.\nAntonio Pipkin won't help matters much, or provide much locker room leadership. In fact, Coach Shanahan's annoyed that you took two raw rookies that will need so much attention: he'll most likely not have any time to work with Pipkin, as he'll be too busy rushing Evans onto the field.\nGo manage your nephew's Pop Warner team, because you're way over your head here.\ngrade: D\n\n*  Congratulations, you have fulfilled your mandated and filled your depth chart:\n1) Brian Hoyer\n2) Chad Kelly\n3) Antonio Pipkin\nFA money spent: $15 million\nDraft picks spent: R4\nThe overall reaction to your QB depth chart is: ehhh.\nYou almost had something going here. A veteran like Brian Hoyer makes for the ideal stopgap/bridge quarterback to the future. He should be able to hold down the fort for a year, while you develop your future QB.\nBut are you counting on Chad Kelly (or Antonio Pipkin) to be that guy? They're both interesting gambles, but no one you should bet the farm on. You're staking a lot on the fact that Kelly will be ready to thrive and start by 2018, if not sooner, given Hoyer's injury history. Rushing Kelly (or Pipkin) out early could damage their confidence.\nOverall, you've made a mess of your QB situation here. On the bright side, you didn't give up many assets to do it, so you can always try again next year. Or play the game again, right now. And tell your friends, why don'tcha. Hopefully they're better at it than you.\ngrade: C-\n\n* Congratulations, you have fulfilled your mandated and filled your depth chart:\n1) Blaine Gabbert\n2) C.J. Beathard\n3) Antonio Pipkin\nFA money spent: $5 million\nDraft picks spent: R4\nThere's no doubt that you may have the worst collection of QBs in the entire NFL.\nThat said: it's not completely insane. You basically \"tanked\" 2017, knowing that your team was unlikely to be competitive anyway. Blaine Gabbert on his own may secure you another top 5 pick in the future, while your saving your FA money and draft picks should help set you up for the future.\nSavvy front office execs also like that you took a chance on two young QBs in C.J. Beathard and Antonio Pipkin. Beathard may very well get some starts this year, and can develop into a solid and long-term backup for you. Pipkin may be a total wild card, but he'll never have an opportunity like this one to shine. Your team will be awful, but it may be interesting to watch.\ngrade: B\n\n* Congratulations, you have fulfilled your mandated and filled your depth chart:\n1) Kirk Cousins\n2) Chad Kelly\n3) Antonio Pipkin\nFA money spent: $41 million\nDraft picks spent: R1 (#2 overall), 2018 R1, R2\nThere's no doubt that you've spent A TON on Kirk Cousins, but he does firmly fill the hole at QB for you. Owner Jed York's happy with the decision, and Coach Shanahan loves having a QB that he can trust his offense with from Day 1. He should be able to spike your win total immediately, which should make that 2018 1st rounder you lost a higher pick than the Redskins realized.\nShanahan and co. aren't thrilled with your backup depth chart, though. On their own, Chad Kelly and Antonio Pipkin would be great upside projects to develop, but developing them both at the same time will present a challenge. To make matters worse, you don't have a single quarterback on your roster ready to step in for Cousins if he gets injured.\nOverall, analysts like your Cousins gambit, but feel like you didn't provide him enough protection.\ngrade: B-\n\n* Congratulations, you have fulfilled your mandated and filled your depth chart:\n1) Kirk Cousins\n2) Christian Ponder\n3) Chad Kelly\nFA money spent: $41 million\nDraft picks spent: R1 (#2 overall), 2018 R1, R2\nThere's no doubt that you invested HEAVILY in Kirk Cousins, which will hurt your ability to build up the rest of the roster. However, coach Kyle Shanahan feels confident that he can patch together the rest of an offense with spare parts and get this team moving the ball again. Between Cousins, Carlos Hyde and Joe Staley, you'll have a solid offense here. If you inch closer to .500 or so, giving up that 2018 1st rounder won't sting so badly.\nAnalysts and local media also like what you've done with the rest of the depth chart. Christian Ponder may not be an exciting name, but he's a competent backup who can fill in if Cousins gets hurt. And Chad Kelly is in an ideal situation here to develop. He has two smart veterans in front of him who won't need much coaching; your staff can put in extra time getting him up to speed. And who knows -- if Kelly keeps his nose clean and thrives -- maybe you can parlay him into a high pick in the future. Well done.\ngrade: A-\n\n* Congratulations, you have fulfilled your mandated and filled your depth chart:\n1) Kirk Cousins\n2) Christian Ponder\n3) C.J. Beathard\nFA money spent: $41 million\nDraft picks spent: R1 (#2 overall), 2018 R1, R2\nThere's no doubt that you've given up a LOT for Kirk Cousins, especially with that #2 pick and the 1st rounder next year. However, having an experienced QB like Cousins should take the sting out of losing that 2018 1st rounder -- the better he plays, the higher that pick gets, and the better your bold gambit looks.\nAnalysts also praise your depth chart behind him. Christian Ponder isn't a world beater, but he's more than capable of a spot start here or there in the unlikely event that Cousins gets hurt. And rookie C.J. Beathard is a smart kid who will benefit from all the experience in that locker room. Shanahan expects him to be on the team for the long haul. Chances are, he'll only be a Christian Ponder type and your future backup, but who knows -- maybe Kyle Shanahan can squeeze out the similarities in Kirk Cousins and land you a steal.\nOverall you've nailed your depth chart, but get docked slightly because of the high price for Cousins.\ngrade: B+"}

And apparently Washington doesn't think he's worth that.\n\nEven if the 49ers are the only team Cousins will agree to go to, if they REALLY want him, Washington still has some leverage.  They can keep 49ers from getting him this year, which forces them to do something else at QB.  Either re-sign Kap or sign another FA or draft a QB with a high pick.  None of these are ideal for Cousins or the 49ers.  No one wants to wait a year to get their \"franchise QB\".  If the deal can get done with trading some draft picks over to Washington, I think the 49ers will gladly cough up a reasonable number of them.\n\nThey aren't going to get anywhere near 2 first rounders, but I could see a deal where they swap firsts.  With maybe some low round picks tossed in on one side or the other to even it up.  And obviously Cousins would be signing a long term deal with the 49ers as part of the package.  Likely overpaying him a decent amount, but that's the QB market for ya.\n\n"}

Neither the multiyear draft strategy nor the draft picks themselves made us better and reasonable people would say MADE US WORSE year over year over year.  \n\n&gt;You're making a HUGE deal out of trading down a few spots. \n\nHardly a huge deal.  I just don't want to repeat the same shit with a different GM.  Maybe this one knows how to draft but with the #2 pick, pretty much anybody can hit a home run.  With the #10, it does become progressively harder. \n\n&gt;So basically, you're saying that trading down wasn't our strategy (that you initially said it was) or that it just wasn't last year? Because how do you account for the other 3 years of the 5? \n\nI don't know what you are saying but the last 5 years with minor exception have been absolutely garbage drafts.  Baalke's best draft is the one Scot McCloughan set up for him.  \n\n&gt;Oh, and I noticed that I made a mistake on my previous reply... they didn't trade down from 18 to 31.\n\nYes, I didn't correct you because I knew what you meant.  This is why I said Baalke was taking a risk to keep his job.  \n\n&gt; Just because Baalke did not hit on his mid-round and late-round picks does not mean that there's no talent in those rounds.\n\nAgree but it is increasingly more difficult to find that talent with consistency---consistency Baalke NEVER demonstrated.  \n\n&gt;we traded down ONCE, from 15 to 17\n\nAre you still only talking about first round picks?  I am talking about Baalke's strategy of collecting mid and late round picks that never/rarely amounted to squat.  \n\n&gt; It seems your issue is with POOR DRAFT RESULTS rather than trading down \n\nAbsolutely.  Let's not have another poor draft by giving up the second overall pick in the draft so we can make more difficult picks later.  We need NFL ready franchise talent out of this draft and we shouldn't be fucking around making decisions primarily driven by hope.  "}

In fact, Clemson USED to run a veer-and-shoot thats very similar to what Baylor ran with RG3. Tajh Boyd ran an offense like RG3. \n\n[Here's](http://www.sbnation.com/college-football/2016/5/18/11670008/deshaun-watson-clemson-football-2016) a good summary of what Clemson runs now. In it, not only is Watson doing a number of pre-snap reads based on motions (similar to what Harbaugh does in Baltimore), but in the passing game he's reading a couple of receivers at a time, not one. Clemsons receivers also run many different version of the route tree, including option routes, so timing and improvisation is important. Dan Mullen ran the same offense with Dak Prescott. Oregon ran a somewhat similar offense, with slightly less wrinkles, with Marcus Mariota. \n\nArt Briles runs the veer and shoot. This is similar to what Oregon is going to run this year. Its a fun offense, but it's different. Receivers really only have two routes - go or hitch. There are no option routes. You're cycling through a progression in order based on the movement of two players on the field, with usually only one option to pass.\n\n\nYou're correct that Manziel ran a similar offense [broken down by Gruden here](http://www.goodbullhunting.com/2014/4/21/5634764/revisiting-johnny-manziel-and-the-texas-a-m-offense-2013-season-nfl-draft). But Johnny IS undersized, and his arm wasn't near as talented as Watson. And I'd argue that Johnny failed out of the NFL for reasons other than his play on the field. The people who claimed that Johnny didn't work through multiple progressions in college were misinformed. Clearly the way he was working his reads was different than how Clemson runs it (back to front vs front to back), but the offenses are fairly similar. "}

Absurd.\n\nIt's not absurd to say that because something has happened three times already it's more likely to happen a fourth time. Certainly more reasonable than giving it a positive correlation, despite every data point suggesting it's a negative.\n\n&gt; I'm saying that we can sign bargain players.\n\nAnd you used a defensive player as an example. Of course we can sign bargain players. Every team in the league tries to sign bargain players. That's what GMs do. What every team in the league doesn't try to do is overpay for supporting cast members, under the presumption that overpaying now will pay off in developing a QB later down the line, as he won't learn to see ghosts.\n\n&gt;But with $80+ mil of cap space this year, we can sign the whole Raiders starting o-line as I'm sure they're spending about $40mil or less on all 5 players.\n\nWe have $80MM this year, as a consequence of holding back in FA for the last few years and carrying over a substantial amount of money. When you sign players to big contracts, you don't evaluate how they impact your cap in the year when you sign them, but how they'll grab your cap three or four years down the road. That's what I mean by \"cap space is never expendable\". We're not playing to fill up the $80MM we have right now, we're playing to sign ~$50MM in players and keep some of that extra space around to pay out those contracts while keeping an eye on our developing players on rookie contracts and the cash we're going to need to spend on them down the line.\n\n&gt;He's getting used to reading defenses and working on the things that coaches think he'd struggle against vs. NFL defenses.\n\nOr, alternatively, coaches are gameplanning around his weaknesses, and he didn't play enough games to get exposed. Again, history suggests this is more likely.\n\n&gt; And he completely torched the Dolphins, who have a pretty good defense.\n\nThe Dolphins defense was average to below average in virtually every single statistic except for fantasy points. The week after the Patriots game the Browns took them to OT.\n\n&gt;And he also did this WITHOUT Gronk.\n\nGreat example of why I don't trust Belichick players. Gronk goes missing for multiple QBs and the offense does not skip a single beat.\n\nIf Lynch and Shanahan feel he's worth trading for, they'll do it whether or not I think it's a good idea, and what do I know, I'm just a fan. I'm certain they'll make a decision that they think is best for the team. I just think Pats QBs are Fool's gold.

Kilgore hasn't been able to stay healthy. Beadles has been okay, but I think he'd be better as a backup who can play all 5 positions on the line. Staley is good, but his age is getting up there and will likely need to be replaced within the next few years.\n\nSo with that in mind, yes--we should be able to find a serviceable guard in the draft, but with the number of lineman we need to replace, it totally makes sense to bring in a talented guard to help kickstart the overhaul, especially since he's relatively young and should be able to continue being a starter when we're ready to compete again."}

When it comes to what we perceive Kyle Shanahan's strengths as an offensive mind are, it seems like a QB has to be more than athletically gifted. Shanahan's QB has to be cerebral, meaning he's thinking about the opposing defense and their looks, is able to make multiple reads down field, and is able to not stare down his receivers.

This is a HORRIBLE example. But anyway, I digress.  \n&amp;nbsp;  \nYou're making a HUGE deal out of trading down a few spots. You're also looking at the picks rather than the players themselves. Just because we trade down a few spots. We're not talking about trading out of the 1st round to grab a bunch of 2nd round picks or late 1st rounders. The guy was trading to get the #10 pick and getting the BEST WR prospect available. Whether this is realistic is a completely different discussion that I won't go into. So you're saying that getting whoever you want at #2 is more of a sure thing than grabbing the best WR prospect available? That is NOT a risk manager's philosophy - and I would know because that's my profession.  \n&amp;nbsp;  \nSo basically, you're saying that trading down wasn't our strategy (that you initially said it was) or that it just wasn't last year? Because how do you account for the other 3 years of the 5? Or does that just not fit your argument so we'll just skip over it? Just because Baalke did not hit on his mid-round and late-round picks does not mean that there's no talent in those rounds. But why are we even discussing his mid and late round picks? Oh, and I noticed that I made a mistake on my previous reply... they didn't trade down from 18 to 31. They traded UP. So out of 6 years that you mentioned, we traded down ONCE, from 15 to 17. One of very little to no consequence. So you're talking about the history of us trading down in the 1st round in the past 6 years when this has happened ONCE. And I wouldn't even really consider it a trade down. It seems your issue is with POOR DRAFT RESULTS rather than trading down and that your idea of our history of trading down in the 1st round was misinformed."}

Neither are sure things, but that's why you've spent two rolls of the dice to get it right.\nHopefully the battle brings out the best in them. Glennon may have more physical upside, whereas Kaaya has a little more savvy and accuracy. Given the fact that you haven't over-leveraged for either one, this represents a smart and calculated risk on your part. Either Glennon holds Kaaya off and relegates him to a role as a \"plus\" backup, or Kaaya beats Glennon and renders him an expensive (and disgruntled backup).\nIt's not a perfect depth chart, as Antonio Pipkin may be wasted on the bench in favor of two QBs who will require all the reps they can get. But overall, your decisions have some logic behind them.\ngrade: B-\n\n* Congratulations, you have fulfilled your mandated and filled your depth chart:\n1) Brian Hoyer\n2) C.J. Beathard\n3) Antonio Pipkin\nFA money spent: $15 million\nDraft picks spent: R4\nNope, sorry. This whole GM thing is not for you.\nIn theory, you selected a smart free agent with Brian Hoyer. He's the ideal bridge quarterback who can carry the load and hold down the fort until your future QB is ready. His experience with Kyle Shanahan is an extra feather in his cap.\nBut then... what? You're going to have to hand the reins over to someone eventually, and in this case it'd be C.J. Beathard. Beathard may be a really solid kid, but he projects to be a Brian Hoyer type himself. Unless you want to be the Game Manager Factory, you're going to have to find a star at some point.\nMaybe that's Antonio Pipkin, but most likely not. If this depth chart plays out the way most would expect (with the team struggling with either Hoyer or Beathard) maybe Pipkin gets a start or two at the end of the year. But most likely: you'll go into 2018, with as many questions as you had in 2017. Way to go, ass.\ngrade: D\n\n* ongratulations, you have fulfilled your mandated and filled your depth chart:\n1) Brian Hoyer\n2) Brad Kaaya\n3) Christian Ponder\nFA money spent: $15 million\nDraft picks spent: R2\nYou played a prudent game here, passing on the big names in the trade market and in the draft.\nOverall, that strategy makes sense. You've acquired a veteran like Brian Hoyer who should be ready to step in as your starter immediately, especially given his experience in Kyle Shanahan's offense. Hoyer can start for a year or more, until you feel like Brad Kaaya is ready for his moment in the spotlight. Allowing Kaaya that extra development time will be crucial for his future.\nOnce again, you made a smart and wise decision by adding Christian Ponder as your 3rd stringer. If Hoyer gets hurt (as he's prone to do), Ponder can immediately leap into that caretaker/bridge role until your staff feels confident in Kaaya.\nYour depth chart gets knocked slightly for its lack of major upside, but there's no denying you're a savvy GM who knows what he's doing.\ngrade: B+\n\n* Congratulations, you have fulfilled your mandated and filled your depth chart:\n1) Deshaun Watson\n2) Blaine Gabbert\n3) Christian Ponder\nFA money spent: $5 million\nDraft picks spent: R1 (#2 overall)\nLet's not create any illusions of a QB competition here -- you've basically handed this job over to Deshaun Watson from Day One.\nAnd that may be okay. Although he's coming from a spread system, Watson has three years of starting experience at Clemson, not to mention a swagger and confidence that shouldn't be shaken by some early struggles.\nBlaine Gabbert and Christian Ponder feel a little repetitive, as both are limited backups with starting experience. But regardless of how they do, your decisions will ultimately come down to how Deshaun Watson looks. The fact that you haven't overspent on FA QBs may help him, by adding more talent to other positions on the field. Overall, it's a lot to ask of the young man, who will have the weight of the franchise on his slender shoulders.\ngrade: B-\n"}

The two firsts thing is only if there is no conversation with the other team. I don't think people are saying that the team is going to do that. Instead, if Washington can't come up with a long term contract for Cousins, and if they don't feel confident that they will be able to do it next year either, they may be open to a conversation about a trade. The 49ers are unlikely to easily part ways with the number 2 overall pick. \n\n**One more thing:** \n\nI've had this idea, and I haven't heard a good reason why it couldn't happen, but let's say that the 49ers are desperate for Cousins, Washington puts the non-exclusive tag on him, but the 49ers can't come to an agreement on compensation with the Redskins.\n\nCouldn't the 49ers trade the 2nd overall pick to someone else? The rule only states that we'd have to part with 2 first round picks, not that the first round pick in question has to be our original pick.\n\nLet's say (just making up an option for an example) Denver decides that they love Trubisky, and Kizer, and they want one of those two guys. Well, one of them will certainly be available at the two spot. What's to stop the 49ers from trading the number 2 pick to Denver in exchange for their first round pick this year, their first round pick next year, and their second round pick this year?\n\nDenver gets a savings, because last year the #2 pick went for two firsts, two seconds and two thirds. The 49ers trade back in the first, give that pick to the Redskins, and give one of the two first rounders from next year away as well...\n\nSo now the 49ers have Kirk Cousins, and in doing so, just moved back to the middle of the second round, and perhaps moved back a few spots in next year's first round, and got a free second rounder next year too... Doesn't that seem like a decent plan?"}

The good thing for them is that in a 4-3 they won't have to play 2 gaps as much as they would in a 3-4. Both of those guys are pretty athletic and hopefully they can show that. \n\nBrooks is probably out. Lynch played 4-3 DE in college, I personally have questions about him in the transition but I could see why some people will get excited. \n\nThe transition also means that we will most likely run a  bump and run Cover 3.

And I'm not sure if it's him, the offense, or his receivers, but he tends to hold the ball too long if it's not a bubble screen pass. It could be his O-line being awful too I guess. And his arm strength is pretty average as well. \n\nI know he would need probably 2 years on the bench, but I like Kizer the most.

Aaron Rodgers on the other, the Packers could afford to let him sit for 2-3 yrs to develop. Yes they had Bret Favre but they also didn't feel obligated to start Rodgers right away because he was the 24th pick. \n\nDon't mean to go on a tirade here just trying to say that when you go 2-11 and and 5-11 the yr before your roster has holes other than qt the QB spot. draft BPA as there is more talent in other positions than at the QB that merit #2 overall.

Let's try to get a franchise player that we can build around and encourages other top talent to want to play for us and not just for the money.  \n  \nThis wasn't our strategy. Last year (2016), we made our pick at #7 and traded up to get a 2nd pick in the 1st round. 2015, we dropped down 2 spots from 15 to 17. 2014, we made our own 1st round pick. 2013, we traded down from 18 to 31. 2012, we made no trades in the 1st round. 2011, we made no trades in the 1st round. So 2 trades in the last 6 years... 1 of which was only 2 spots down. I would disagree that THIS is the reason for our depleted roster. I'd attribute it to 3 things:  \n1) Drafting strategy of taking risk on college players with injury history (ACLs namely)  \n2) Early retirements (Patrick Willis, Chris Borland, Anthony Davis)  \n3) Players that didn't pan out (AJ Jenkins)  "}

Kaaya may not be John Elway in terms of physical skills, but he comes into the NFL with three years of starting experience. He's most likely more ready to play than other rookies in his class, and could be able to log the majority of the snaps for you this season.\nHe'll be aided in that cause by a veteran like Schaub, who has extensive experience with the Kyle Shanahan system, dating back to Kyle's first OC post with the Houston Texans. Furthermore, Christian Ponder adds another veteran with starting experience. Both of them don't need many practice reps, which allows Kaaya to soak in all the time he needs.\nThere's no guarantees of success here, but Kaaya couldn't ask for a better situation and better mentors around him. You've done an admirable job building around him.\ngrade: B+\n\n* Congratulations, you have fulfilled your mandated and filled your depth chart:\n1) Landry Jones\n2) Chad Kelly\n3) Antonio Pipkin\nFA money spent: $9 million\nDraft picks spent: R4\nThere's only one person thrilled with this depth chart -- Landry Jones.\nFor the first time in his career, he'll have a clear path forward to start. Chad Kelly and Antonio Pipkin, while talented, aren't ready for prime time, especially given the fact that Kelly's nursing his ACL. It'll be Landry, and all Landry, for the majority of 2017.\nAnd that may get ugly. Jones hasn't proven to be a serviceable starter so far, which may make you one of the worst teams in the league. If he flops before midseason, you may have to rush the rookies into the lineup too quickly, which may ruin their confidence.\nFortunately, you've saved your FA money and draft picks for the future, because you'll need it.\ngrade: D\n\n* Congratulations, you have fulfilled your mandated and filled your depth chart:\n1) Matt Schaub\n2) Brad Kaaya\n3) Antonio Pipkin\nFA money spent: $5 million\nDraft picks spent: R2\nMatt Schaub may be listed as the starter on the pre-season depth chart, but this will be Brad Kaaya's job sooner or later, maybe even by opening day.\nAnd that may be okay.

He's most likely more ready to play than other rookies in his class, and could be able to log the majority of the snaps for you this season.\nHe'll be aided in that cause by a veteran like Schaub, who has extensive experience with the Kyle Shanahan system, dating back to Kyle's first OC post with the Houston Texans. Schaub and Shanahan should put Kaaya in a position to be successful.\nAll in all, your chart makes sense, although there's naturally some risk involved when you pair two rookies with an over-the-hill vet.\ngrade: B\n\n* Congratulations, you have fulfilled your mandated and filled your depth chart:\n1) Deshaun Watson\n2) Matt Barkley\n3) Antonio Pipkin\nFA money spent: $9 million\nDraft picks spent: R1 (#2 overall)\nIt's the start of a new era in San Fran -- Deshaun Watson is officially the face of your franchise.\nYou've practically ensured that by not giving him much competition in the locker room. Matt Barkley's a solid pro who may be able to start for some teams, but he can't hold off the shiny new toy for long. Watson should be starting for the majority of the season.\nAll in all, that's not such a bad thing. Watson's coming armed with 3 years of experience at Clemson, and has the confidence to succeed as a rookie starter. In fact, Watson + Matt Barkley could represent a great starter+backup combination for a long time coming.\nAntonio Pipkin may toil deep on your bench, since all your coaching and reps will go to Watson, but he can hang around on the practice squad.\ngrade: B+\n\n* Congratulations, you have fulfilled your mandated and filled your depth chart:\n1) Mike Glennon\n2) Christian Ponder\n3) C.J. Beathard\nFA money spent: $19 million\nDraft picks spent: R4\nMike Glennon is thrilled that you didn't add any real competition to him here, allowing him the clear opportunity to start for the first time in his career.\nBut is that a good thing? Glennon's shown some tools, but accuracy and agility hasn't been one of them. The chances of him sticking around as a long-term starter may be less than 50/50.\nGiven that, people are skeptical about the rest of your depth chart. Christian Ponder can serve as a capable backup, and young C.J. Beathard will be groomed to fill the same role -- but can they ever challenge Glennon? The fact that you haven't added any viable competition for Glennon may end up biting you in the ass if the Big Ginger doesn't deliver.\nOverall, this depth chart doesn't inspire much confidence in your abilities.\ngrade: C-\n\n* Congratulations, you have fulfilled your mandated and filled your depth chart:\n1) Mike Glennon\n2) Jerod Evans\n3) Antonio Pipkin\nFA money spent: $19 million\nDraft picks spent: R2\nMike Glennon's not thrilled with this depth chart, as he feels deja vu from his time in Tampa Bay. Once again, a big talented QB has been drafted behind him, eyeing to steal his job as soon as possible.\nOn the plus side, the timing may actually work out here. As a one-year starter at Virginia Tech, Jerod Evans is a raw rookie. He'll need some time to develop, and that may be 1-2 years. Glennon, on a two year guaranteed deal, can hold down the fort until then. Your 2017 should be fairly predictable, with Glennon starting and Evans soaking up reps behind him.\nBy 2018, this may get more complicated. Evans should be ready for live action, but Glennon will still be under a guaranteed contract. You won't be able to trade Glennon easily, especially since you don't have another veteran on your roster to serve as a backup (Antonio Pipkin can't fit that bill.)\nOverall, it's an interesting depth chart, but a little messy.\ngrade: C+\n\n* Congratulations, you have fulfilled your mandated and filled your depth chart:\n1) Matt Barkley\n2) Brad Kaaya\n3) Christian Ponder\nFA money spent: $9 million\nDraft picks spent: R2\nThere are a lot of similarities between the QBs on your roster, but that may not be such a good thing.\nBrad Kaaya projects as a smart, pro-style passer with some limits to his upside -- he's basically a little better version of Matt Barkley. That makes your plan of succession relatively clear -- Barkley will start at the beginning of the season, but should give way to Kaaya before the end of 2017.\nThe problem here is: it's not a huge upgrade. Neither QB -- nor Christian Ponder on the bench -- offers a massive amount of upside. It's a safe depth chart -- perhaps too safe.\ngrade: B-\n"}

From what I've read, the ideal player for that position is your best interior pass rusher, a guy who can be explosive into a gap.

The most talked about scenario is trading with the Bills so they can move up to get a QB at 2.  We'd get #10 this year and their first next year.  If they are moving up for a QB then that means Taylor is gone and they are going into next year with a rookie QB and likely a journeyman type player (and a brand new system/coaching staff).  I'd say there is a decent chance that pick is top 10 next year.  The Niners hopefully improve but I'd put us in the top 10 next year as well.\n\nSo for dropping back 8 spots this year we could still end up having the 10th pick this year and two top 10 picks next year.

{"cat": "sports", "txt": "Speaking as a Pats fan who's looked at this because I'm interested in the whole Jimmy G situation but doesn't really have a dog in the rookie QB fight other than that...\n\nIf you look at 1st round QBs since 2010:\n\n1. Jared Goff  \n2. Carson Wentz  \n26. Paxton Lynch  \n1. Jameis Winston  \n2. Marcus Mariota  \n3. Blake Bortles  \n22. Johnny Manziel  \n32. Teddy Bridgewater  \n16. EJ Manuel  \n1. Andrew Luck  \n2. Robert Griffin  \n8. Ryan Tannehill  \n22. Brandon Weeden  \n1. Cam Newton  \n8. Jake Locker  \n10. Blaine Gabbert  \n12. Christian Ponder  \n1. Sam Bradford  \n25. Tim Tebow  \n\nYou notice that the success rate is pretty poor. Luck, Newton, Mariota, and Winston have been the only clear hits and notwithstanding his brilliant 2015 I have some long term doubts about Newton. Wentz was a mixed bag last season but looks promising. Bradford's developed into an OK journeyman QB after getting shipped off by his first two teams. Tannehill's not great, but he's durable and is a guy who looks like he'll be one of the best 25 QBs in the league for a long time. That's something. Other than that, its ugly.\n\nBut what strikes my eye is that those 4 big successes, the promising rookie, and the OK journeyman were all top two overall picks. Winston, Luck, Cam, and Bradford went #1 overall. Mariota and Wentz went #2 overall.\n\nObviously if we go back further we can find like Big Ben (#11 overall) and Aaron Rodgers (#26)... but I still think it's a reasonable takeaway to conclude that mid-late 1st round QBs are scratch tickets with an exceedingly high chance of being a bust, but that QBs who are good enough to get taken 1st or 2nd overall have had a good hit rate in recent years.\n\nThe question of course becomes whether a guy like Trubisky really merits a #1 or #2 overall pick. Just taking a guy in the top 2 doesn't magically improve the odds of success, it's just that guys who are good enough for a team to pull the trigger that early have a pretty good track record in recent years."}

I don't really have the expertise to determine that, but the 49ers guys would have the tape and expertise. In my opinion though, at this point, Jimmy is the best option of all the QBs. Watson was a great college QB, no doubt about it. But I don't think he'll be successful in the NFL. I think he'll probably be similar to a Tyrod Taylor, which is not someone I'd spend a 1st round pick. With Trubisky, I also feel he's got a pretty limited ceiling. He's got the short/mid accuracy, but his deep ball is iffy. I think he needs a lot of work before he's ready to be NFL ready, but he seems to have the mental aspect down. I think he'd end up being Chad Pennington. Kizer is the only other guy that I see being a consensus 1st round pick. He seems to be another QB that relies on ability rather than technique/mechanics. We had someone like that in Kap. I think he's a slightly more accurate version, but without the same speed. I think in any other draft, Kizer wouldn't even be considered as a 1st rounder. Kaaya, Webb, and Mahomes are all interesting prospects, but all need to improve on technique.  \n&amp;nbsp;  \nI'd say Jimmy is the most NFL ready of all these guys. Is he going to be elite? Honestly, anyone who says they know for sure is full of crap. Just like most of them \"knew\" Kap was going to be super elite.  But training with Brady hopefully would have rubbed off on on him in a positive way. If he could bring that same competitiveness and work ethic and the Patriots worked on his flaws while he has been sitting behind Brady, I think his floor is the highest of all the QBs. His ceiling is pretty high too. In terms of throwing, his issue was deep ball accuracy. But his mechanics were good and definitely had the mental aspect down.  \n&amp;nbsp;  \nAs for the cap space, I guess it comes down to philosophy and how Lynch will be using it. I've said in the past that I wouldn't be signing any big ticket FAs this year because I don't think we're going to be competing. I expect a 5 or 6 win season at best, so I don't see a point to that. What I would do is sign some older veterans to fill roster holes and mentor young players. I'm not saying just get all the old guys, but every year there have been quality players that teams wait to sign. Boldin was one of those guys last year. Raiders did it with Justin Tuck. If I can get some of these players at value and just front load the contract, I can try to carry over a bunch of space to next year. Instead of drafting a rookie QB and surrounding him with high-priced FAs, I'd take the 1-year chance at Jimmy G and surround him with promising rookies and older veterans. If he balls out, I'll pay him. Hopefully the rookies pan out and those will be the ones locked into the rookie contract. Eventually, everyone will need to be paid though and we'll have to worry about the salary cap 3-4 years down the line. Probably end up having to let some talent walk, but at least I'll have my franchise QB and young talent. And the talent that leaves, I will be compensated via compensatory picks. Or maybe I can trade them if they're expendable.  \n&amp;nbsp;  \nI'm not saying that Jimmy's definitely the guy or great. But in terms of the risk, I think it makes sense. But it will come down to how Lynch and Shan evaluate him vs. the guys in the draft. If they think one of the guys in the draft have a higher ceiling, then all bets are off."}

Maybe I took your statement that *'literally anyone is an improvement'* too... literally, but I don't think there are 31 GMs better than Baalke currently in the league.. I'd rank him somewhere around 16 personally. Baalke gets a lot of hate because of the Harbaugh history. But DePodesta, Tannenbaum, Ryan Grigson, Mickey Loomis, Rick Smith, Les Snead, those guys are legitimately awful GMs. Al Davis, now that was a bad GM.

If they draft a rookie then they could go out and bring in a QB who has experience in Shanahan's system to help mentor him. \n\nI'm just tired of watching Kap play QB for the 49ers."}

{"cat": "sports", "txt": "\n* Congratulations, you have fulfilled your mandated and filled your depth chart:\n1) Mike Glennon\n2) Christian Ponder\n3) Chad Kelly\nFA money spent: $19 million\nDraft picks spent: R4\nMike Glennon is thrilled that you didn't add any real competition to him here, allowing him the clear opportunity to start for the first time in his career.\nBut is that a good thing? Glennon's shown some tools, but accuracy and agility hasn't been one of them. The chances of him sticking around as a long-term starter may be less than 50/50.\nOn the bright side, you've assembled a solid depth chart behind him. Christian Ponder can serve as the experienced backup, and won't need a lot of reps to maintain that role. Behind him, you rolled the dice on the ultimate gamble in Chad Kelly. Protected in that 3rd role to start, he'll be able to slowly develop at his own pace, with a smart vet like Ponder helping him out. By the end of the next two years, Kelly may turn out to be your best investment among the group.\ngrade: B-\n\n* Congratulations, you have fulfilled your mandated and filled your depth chart:\n1) Mitch Trubisky\n2) Blaine Gabbert\n3) Antonio Pipkin\nFA money spent: $5 million\nDraft picks spent: R1 (#2 overall)\nUhhh...\nHm...\nWe're trying to be delicate here, on the chance that you're mentally challenged. If so, great job!\nIf not, we've got some problems here. You invested a #2 pick in Mitch Trubisky, with the knowledge that he'll need some time to develop. After all, he's a one-year starter coming from a spread system.\nInstead, you did nothing to help him out. He needs time on the bench -- or at least, a steady hand in the QB room who can help him along. Blaine Gabbert only partly does that -- and Antonio Pipkin does the opposite, as a young kid who will drain your QB coach's time himself.\nChances are, Trubisky will start sooner than you'd like, and chances are, he'll look bad in the process. Having a #2 pick struggle is a recipe for disaster, and firing. Just ask Jeff Fisher.\ngrade: D\n\n* Congratulations, you have fulfilled your mandated and filled your depth chart:\n1) Mitch Trubisky\n2) Blaine Gabbert\n3) Christian Ponder\nFA money spent: $5 million\nDraft picks spent: R1 (#2 overall)\nYou're \"all in\" on Mitch Trubisky here, as you haven't brought in any other QBs who can realistically compete with him right away. Blaine Gabbert and Christian Ponder have experience, but don't have enough of a rep to hold off the hype train of a #2 pick.\nAnd regardless of Trubisky's skill, that may be a problem. After all, Trubisky's a one-year starter coming from a simplified spread offense. In theory, he'd be better served soaking up reps behind a starter, not being rushed onto the field before he's ready.\nOverall, you drafted your franchise QB, but haven't allowed him the best chance to succeed. There's a chance that Trubisky can overcome that, but you're putting the kid through an uphill battle.\ngrade: C-\n\n* Congratulations, you have fulfilled your mandated and filled your depth chart:\n1) Blaine Gabbert\n2) Brad Kaaya\n3) Christian Ponder\nFA money spent: $5 million\nDraft picks spent: R2\nThe reaction your draft has been mixed. On the bright side, you have cornered the market on disappointing first-round QBs (and made Jed York happy with all this handsomeness!). But this isn't supposed to be a boy band, this is supposed to be an NFL franchise.\nOn that end, your depth chart looks worse on paper than it may actually be. Blaine Gabbert and Christian Ponder can hold down the fort for a little while, but will ultimately give way to Brad Kaaya starting sooner than later. And maybe that's not such a bad thing -- he's a plus prospect who will have two vets in the QB room helping him out. The fact that Kaaya comes armed with 3 years of starting experience should help make him game-ready more quickly than other rookies; based on your depth chart, he'll need it.\nYou also earn points for not over-spending in terms of your FA guaranteed money or your draft picks. This was a solid, safe draft.\ngrade: B\n"}

{"cat": "sports", "txt": "List for people who hate slideshows:\n\nRB CHRIS THOMPSON, WASHINGTON\n\n\nThompson, 26, was a fifth-round draft pick while Mike Shanahan was Washington\u2019s head coach and Kyle Shanahan was the offensive coordinator. He played in four games as a rookie as a return specialist.\n\nHe is a restricted free agent because he was cut prior to the 2014 season (when the Shanahans were gone). He was re-signed late in the season but is not accredited with \nan accrued season.\n\nThompson (5 foot 8, 195 pounds) is a nice fit as a third-down back in Shanahan\u2019s scheme to go along with Carlos Hyde. He carried 68 times for 356 yards and two TDs last season, but is a valuable pass-catcher out of the backfield with 49 receptions for 349 yards.\n\nLB KEENAN ROBINSON, N.Y. GIANTS\n\nHe was a fourth-round pick of Washington in 2012, but sustained some injuries that set back his career. In 2014, he recorded 109 tackles in 13 starts in Washington.\n\nRobinson, who turns 28 in July, had a strong season with the Giants last season. (New 49ers defensive line coach Jeff Zgonina was the Giants assistant defensive line coach last season.)\n\nThe 49ers need help at inside linebacker. Robinson (6-3, 238) had a strong season as the middle linebacker in the Giants\u2019 sub packages, but he could easily become an every down player for the 49ers.\n\nWR PIERRE GARCON, WASHINGTON\n\nGarcon turns 31 in August, but he showed he still has something left. He is coming off the second 1,000-yard season of his nine-year NFL career.\n\nHis best season came in 2013 when Kyle Shanahan was Washington\u2019s offensive coordinator. He caught 113 passes for 1,346 yards and five touchdowns. Garcon is a good complement to Torrey Smith, who would be the speed threat on the other side.\n\nGarcon can also help mentor any young receivers the 49ers might select in the draft because of his knowledge of Shanahan\u2019s system.\n\nQB MATT SCHAUB, ATLANTA\n\nThe 49ers will unquestionably be looking to add quarterbacks via all available options: free agency, trade and the draft. Regardless of whatever moves are made at this position, Schaub would appear to fit.\n\nHe turns 36 in June, so he would not be considered a long-term starter. He might not even be a short-term starter. But Schaub knows Shanahan\u2019s system. He had his best seasons under Shanahan with the Houston Texans.\n\nHe could be the backup to a veteran. He could be the backup to a rookie. He could even be the bridge starter until a young player is ready to take over. The 49ers need somebody for this role. Schaub and Brian Hoyer are the most logicial options.\n\nDE JABAAL SHEARD, NEW ENGLAND\n\nAside from quarterback, the 49ers\u2019 biggest position of need is pass-rusher. Since the club parted ways with Aldon Smith, the 49ers have not been able to generate any consistent pressure on opposing quarterbacks.\n\nThe 49ers have some good pieces for the defensive line with DeForest Buckner, Arik Armstead, Quinton Dial and Mitchell. But what they lack is a pass-rusher. Shanahan and 49ers defensive backs coach Jeff Hafley know Sheard from their time together with the Browns in 2014.\n\nSheard, who turns 28 in May, has 36 career sacks in six NFL seasons. At 6-3, 265 pounds, Sheard would fit the 49ers\u2019 scheme as an edge pass-rusher who is five years younger than Ahmad Brooks."}

{"cat": "sports", "txt": "* Congratulations, you have fulfilled your mandated and filled your depth chart:\n1) Landry Jones\n2) Jerod Evans\n3) Antonio Pipkin\nFA money spent: $9 million\nDraft picks spent: R2\nYou may not have a lot of big names on this depth chart, but there's a logical plan in place.\nLandry Jones will be the starter at the beginning of the season, but will presumably give way to Jerod Evans. The key to your success may depend on how long Landry Jones can last in that role. As a one-year starter coming from a simplified college system, Evans isn't ready to start right now. If Landry Jones can hold down the fort for 8+ games, Evans will be better off. If Landry Jones flops, Evans may be rushed into service too early.\nAll in all, you're in store for a lot of losses with this group, but at least you've taken a few swings here. Landry Jones, Jerod Evans, and Antonio Pipkin all offer long-term upside, which is what you need when you're not going to win a lot of games.\ngrade: C+\n\n* Congratulations, you have fulfilled your mandated and filled your depth chart:\n1) Mike Glennon\n2) Jerod Evans\n3) Christian Ponder\nFA money spent: $19 million\nDraft picks spent: R2\nAlert Wes Mantooth -- we've got a brawl going down that he may want to get in on.\nMike Glennon vs. Jerod Evans. Two big kids who represent two big question marks. The fact that both of them are relatively raw may not be a good thing, because your staff will have to devote attention and reps to each.\nOf course, this battle may be tilted in favor of Glennon, the vet who's coming in with NFL experience and a new free agent contract. Chances are, he'll start in 2017, but by 2018, all bets are off. You've only guaranteed Glennon's contract for 2 years, so if Evans beats him out by then, you can get off the hook for the rest of the deal.\nOverall, it's a competition that makes some sense, although there's some natural risk here given the upside/downside of both players.\ngrade: B\n\n* Congratulations, you have fulfilled your mandated and filled your depth chart:\n1) Mitch Trubisky\n2) Matt Schaub\n3) Antonio Pipkin\nFA money spent: $5 million\nDraft picks spent: R1 (#2 overall)\nYou have a lot of confidence in Mitch Trubisky, that's for sure. Not only did you draft him with the #2 pick, you didn't give him any realistic competition for the job. Trubisky will be starting from Day One.\nAnd that may be a problem. As a one-year starter coming from a spread system, Trubisky will have a steep learning curve. You would have been better off allowing him to develop behind a more established and viable starter.\nBut provided Trubisky can get over those growing pains, the rest of your depth chart makes sense. Matt Schaub can serve as the veteran mentor, while Antonio Pipkin offers more upside as a development project.\nOverall, you've invested heavily in Trubisky -- perhaps too much so.\ngrade: C-\n\n* Congratulations, you have fulfilled your mandated and filled your depth chart:\n1) Matt Schaub\n2) Jerod Evans\n3) Antonio Pipkin\nFA money spent: $5 million\nDraft picks spent: R2\nLet me guess: you're from Virginia? After all, you did grab two Virginia college kids in Matt Schaub and Jerod Evans. It's a shame that Michael Vick retired, or else he could have filled the mobile 3rd string role currently slated to Antonio Pipkin.\nBut despite that, there's some method to this madness. Matt Schaub makes for an ideal veteran mentor, giving his starting experience, and his years and years in Coach Kyle Shanahan's system. In theory, he can pass that knowledge down to Evans, who will eventually take this starter's role.\nThe only problem is: Schaub may not have enough gas left in the tank to meet Evans and hand him the keys. If Schaub doesn't look ready to log a few games for you, that means that Evans will the staff will have to rush Evans onto the field before he's ready. Evans is a talented kid who thrived for coach Justin Fuente, but we said the same about Paxton Lynch, and we all know how he looked as a rookie. 3rd stringer Pipkin won't help matters out, either.\nSimply put, your plan made sense, but it may be asking too much for Evans right now.\ngrade: C\n\n\n* Congratulations, you have fulfilled your mandated and filled your depth chart:\n1) Mike Glennon\n2) C.J. Beathard\n3) Antonio Pipkin\nFA money spent: $19 million\nDraft picks spent: R4\nMike Glennon is thrilled that you didn't add any real competition to him here, allowing him the clear opportunity to start for the first time in his career.\nBut is that a good thing? Glennon's shown some tools, but accuracy and agility hasn't been one of them. The chances of him sticking around as a long-term starter may be less than 50/50.\nGiven that, people are skeptical about the rest of your depth chart. C.J. Beathard projects as a \"plus\" backup down the road, but he may not be ready to fill the shoes quite yet. Antonio Pipkin has promise, but won't be able to get many reps on a team with two young QBs ahead of him.\nOverall, you've shown too much faith in Glennon, and didn't add enough talent behind him.\ngrade: D\n\n* Congratulations, you have fulfilled your mandated and filled your depth chart:\n1) Matt Barkley\n2) Christian Ponder\n3) C.J. Beathard\nFA money spent: $9 million\nDraft picks spent: R4\nDo the 49ers regret trading Alex Smith? Maybe. But that doesn't mean you should try to aspire to be Alex Smith with every spot on your depth chart.\nMatt Barkley, Christian Ponder, and C.J. Beathard are all physically limited game managers -- which doesn't quite work when there's not much talent around you to manage. Moreover, there's not a clear line of development here. If you work with C.J. Beathard and bring out the best in him, what's he going to become -- Matt Barkley?\nAll in all, the best thing you've done with this depth chart is save your bullets. You haven't spent much money or wasted picks on QB, which essentially punts your QB decision to 2018. Presuming you keep your job until then.\ngrade: C-\n\n* Congratulations, you have fulfilled your mandated and filled your depth chart:\n1) Matt Schaub\n2) Christian Ponder\n3) Chad Kelly\nFA money spent: $5 million\nDraft picks spent: R4\nThis depth chart may read like an intervention for Chad Kelly.\nYou've acquired two smart veterans in Matt Schaub and Christian Ponder who may not offer much in terms of wins and losses, but do help you out in the locker room.\nBecause make no mistake: Chad Kelly will be the QB that everyone will be watching on your trainwreck of a team. If Schaub and Ponder can hold down the fort for a month or two (which may be unlikely), they can ultimately allow you a chance to audition Chad Kelly down the stretch. If he keeps his head on straight and his nose clean, there's a chance he may be your starting QB in 2018. It provides at least some storyline to watch for your fans as they watch you struggle to win a game this year.\ngrade: C-\n"}

Either due to lack of production, cost, or both.  \nMost notably:  \n**Colin Kaepernick:** This is the most obvious. Whether he opts out or we cut him, he'll be gone. That will free up $15,000,000 in cap space next season.  \n**Ahmad Brooks:** He seems to be on the potential cut list on a yearly basis. He may make it through again due to the lack of depth at OLB, but his performance and effort are dwindling and cutting him would save $8,000,000  \n**Antoine Bethea:** He looked absolutely awful last season, and is due to make $7mil this year. With Tartt waiting in the wings, it may make sense to part ways with a past his prime safety. The only reason I see to keep him around is veteran leadership. Cutting Bethea would save another $5,750,000.  \n**Tramaine Brock:** The 49ers have a lot of young corners and Brock tends to have the knack for giving up big plays. Again, he adds a veteran presence, but with Robinson and Ward the presumptive starters, and a decent amount of veterans available in free agency, Ward may be expendable at a $3,500,000 savings.  \n  \nAdd it all up and cutting these 4 guys could add another $32,000,000 to our $81,000,000 in cap space.

A mid first rounder is the absolutely highest value given out in this scenario.\nThe Bradford and Carson Palmer trades are similar trades with established QB's that had significant salary cap hits, already had truckloads of money and were pissed at their franchises.\n\nBradford went for a 1st (#17), and a conditional 2018, which will be a 4th round pick. This has a trade value of around 1020 points.\n\nPalmer went for a 1st (#17) and a 2nd (#37). This has a trade points value of around 1480 points. Now this trade is considered one of the most lop sided trades in history and is one of the main reasons Hue Jackson got sacked at the end of that year.\n\nI think a realistic value is a lot closer to Bradford's points value and quite possibly lower considering the 6 year teneurs of 49ers GM and coach. They don't want to be doing anything too risky or stupid right now. Also the fact that if Cousins is franchised and stays this year at the Skins, they risk him walking for zero compensation next year.\nSo if I'm GM, I'm thinking 800-1100 points range is fair value.\n\nNow, what is the #2 pick worth in points? 2600 points. That value is pretty safe. What is the 49ers 2nd round pick (#34) worth? 560 points. What is the Redskins #17 pick worth? 950.\n\nSo swapping 1st would result in the Skins picking coming out ahead by 1550. This simply isn't going to happen. They need to get it down by another 600.\n\nSome realistic scenarios:\n\n1. would be be a trade of swapping firsts, plus the Skins give up their 2nd round pick (#49 410 pts), their 3rd round pick (#81 185 pts). Gaining a total of 955 points.\n2. 49ers give their 2nd (#34 560 pts), their 3rd (260 pts) and next years 3rd (~200 points) for a total of 1020. 49ers can then trade down from the #2 to pick up some lost picks.\n3. 49ers trade down from #2 close to trade day and give a mid first round draft pick (#14 - #21) and get some compensation back if it's around the lower end of that mark.\n\nAll of these trades can have some conditional 4th and 5th round trades tacked on either way depending on negotiation."}
{"cat": "sports", "txt": "The hiring of Kyle Shanahan as coach of the San Francisco 49ers concludes what turned out to be a fast NFL coach-hiring season.\n\nEDITOR'S PICKS\n\nPlenty of work ahead for 49ers' Kyle Shanahan, John Lynch\nIn the coming weeks, new coach Kyle Shanahan and GM John Lynch must form their coaching staff, find the right fit at QB and prepare for the NFL draft.\n\nRams coach Sean McVay can learn from newly hired DC Wade Phillips\nThe youngest head coach in NFL history will have one of the most successful and well-traveled defensive coordinators on his Rams staff.\n\nGary Kubiak lauds Broncos' hiring of Vance Joseph as head coach\nGary Kubiak, who stepped down as Broncos coach after the season ended, praised the character of Vance Joseph, who was on Kubiak's staff in Houston.\nFive of the six head-coaching jobs that were open became finalized between Jan. 9 and Jan. 12. The 49ers felt they had the luxury of waiting until after the Super Bowl to hire a coach, and they targeted the top two assistants available. New England Patriots offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels removed his name from consideration and decided to stay with the Patriots for another season. The 49ers then set their sights on Shanahan, who coordinated the offense of the Atlanta Falcons that lost in thrilling fashion to McDaniels' Patriots in Super Bowl LI.\n\nThat gave Shanahan a great amount of leverage, and he's taking a six-year guaranteed contract and will get significant personnel power in shaping the roster.\n\nShanahan is one of the biggest winners of the NFL coaching carousel. Who joins him, and who's on the other side? Here's my list.\n\n\nWINNERS\n\nLos Angeles Rams ownership\n\nThe Sean McVay hire was the most interesting and could reap the most benefits for owner Stan Kroenke. McVay is 31 and bright, and he could help rekindle hope for the franchise. McVay did a great job putting together a coaching staff. He got Wade Phillips, Joe Barry and Bill Johnson on defense. Getting Greg Olson as a quarterbacks coach was a steal. Olson has worked with Derek Carr and Blake Bortles, among others, and should help develop No. 1 overall pick Jared Goff. This was a creative, interesting move.\n\nTom Coughlin, vice president, Jacksonville Jaguars\n\nCoughlin took being fired as coach of the New York Giants hard. Now he gets another shot with a team, overseeing football operations for a Jaguars franchise that has some young, talented players. Coughlin will have a great deal of power. He picks the 53-man roster, and the general manager and coach answer to him.\n\nVance Joseph, coach, Denver Broncos\n\nSome assistants wait years and years to get a head-coaching job in the NFL. Joseph got a head-coaching job after being a defensive coordinator for one year, and the Miami Dolphins defensive numbers weren't great. Joseph knew Broncos general manager John Elway had his eyes on him for the past three years. The resignation of Gary Kubiak gave Joseph the chance to get a head-coaching job years ahead of expectations, and the team he inherits has a roster built to win immediately.\n\nAaron Donald, defensive tackle, Los Angeles Rams\n\nDonald, one of the best defensive tackles in the league, gets the best turnaround defensive coordinator in the NFL in Wade Phillips. Phillips worked with J.J. Watt in Houston and Von Miller in Denver. He knows how to get the best out of great players and coach up the defense around them.\n\nSeattle Seahawks\n\nThe unexpected turnover of two coaching staffs in the NFC West -- the 49ers and Rams -- could help squeeze out an extra divisional win or two and help secure a playoff bye in 2017. Jeff Fisher always gave Pete Carroll trouble with the Rams. And now, with three coaching changes in three years and a depleted roster, the 49ers will struggle to beat the Seahawks.\n\nAnthony Lynn, coach, Los Angeles Chargers\n\nIf you think Joseph's rise was fast, what about Lynn's? He started the season under the radar as a running backs coach for the Buffalo Bills. He took over as offensive coordinator during the season and now gets a chance as head coach with the Chargers. He had never been a coordinator before the 2016 season.\n\nMarcell Dareus &amp; Jerry Hughes, defensive linemen, Buffalo Bills\n\nJim Schwartz was the Bills' defensive coordinator in 2014, and he had the team playing at a high level in a 4-3 scheme, racking up 54 sacks and ranking fourth in the league in points per game (18.1). When Rex Ryan was hired, he switched the Bills to a 3-4, and Dareus' and Hughes' sack totals fell off a cliff. Ryan's defense -- supposed to be his calling card -- got him fired in Buffalo. Let's see if the Bills' defense can improve in new coach Sean McDermott's 4-3.\n\n\nLOSERS\n\nSan Francisco 49ers fans\n\nThe fact that owner Jed York is giving a six-year contract to general manager John Lynch and the same to Shanahan indicates that it is going to be years before the 49ers get back to the playoffs. Shanahan could struggle to put the best coaching staff together because it's so late in the process. And while it's smart to give a first-time coach and first-time general manager extra time to build a roster that lacks talent, San Francisco fans are in for a long ride back to success.\n\nDave Caldwell, general manager, Jacksonville Jaguars\n\nCaldwell had a solid 2016 offseason in which he added defensive tackle Malik Jackson and safety Tashaun Gipson in free agency and chose cornerback Jalen Ramsey, linebacker Myles Jack and defensive end Yannick Ngakoue in the draft. But the Jaguars didn't show improvement, going 3-13. Now Caldwell loses control of the Jags' 53-man roster to Coughlin.\n\nDenver Broncos' defense\n\nThe Broncos ranked among the best defenses in the history of the NFL under Wade Phillips in 2015, and they were great again in 2016. But the Broncos let Phillips walk, and he landed in Los Angeles. It's hard to see how that doesn't weaken the Super Bowl 50 champs.\n\nDefenders tied to 3-4 schemes\n\nMcDermott with the Bills and defensive coordinator Gus Bradley with the Chargers have backgrounds in 4-3 defenses, which could mean moves away from the 3-4. One example of whom this affects: Linebacker Lorenzo Alexander had a Pro Bowl season with 12.5 sacks in Rex Ryan's 3-4, but he might not have a spot in a 4-3.\n\nTyrod Taylor, Buffalo Bills &amp; Colin Kaepernick, San Francisco 49ers\n\nBoth quarterbacks have lucrative long-term contracts that are likely going to be blown up in the next month or so. Taylor might have an outside chance to keep his $18 million-a-year extension with the Bills, but it seems the organization wants to move on. Buffalo would suffer only a $3 million dead-money hit against the 2017 cap if it releases him before March 11. Kaepernick has no money guaranteed on his contract and will likely be on the market, too.\n\nChip Kelly\n\nTwo years ago, Kelly was coming off back-to-back 10-win seasons with the Philadelphia Eagles. Now, he has been fired by two NFL teams in two years and might have to take an offensive consulting job to stay busy until a top college program evaluates him next year."}

He's going to need all the coaching time and development he needs, because he won't have much time to learn the system before being thrown into the starting lineup.\nAnd that could be a problem. As a one-year starter at UNC, Trubisky would be better served learning behind an established veteran for half a season before being handled the keys to the kingdom. Unfortunately, Landry Jones isn't experienced enough as a starter to serve that role, or function as a good veteran mentor in the locker room.\nChristian Ponder may actually be better equipped for both of those roles, as someone who won't need much development, and someone who can help Trubisky learn the ins and outs of the NFL. It may take all the king's horses and all the king's men to make sure Trubisky isn't broken by the blitz again.\ngrade: C\n\n* Congratulations, you have fulfilled your mandated and filled your depth chart:\n1) Mitch Trubisky\n2) Landry Jones\n3) Antonio Pipkin\nFA money spent: $9 million\nDraft picks spent: R1 (#2 overall)\nYou haven't given Mitch Trubisky much competition here, which means the #2 pick could be starting from day one.\nAnd that could be a problem. As a one-year starter coming from a QB-friendly spread, Trubisky would be better served having some development time. Landry Jones may be a serviceable bridge, but he doesn't have enough of a rep to hold off a #2 pick. That means Trubisky will be thrown to the wolves, for better or worse.\n3rd stringer Antonio Pipkin may be wasted in that circumstance as well. Kyle Shanahan and the coaches will have to work overtime to get Trubisky up to speed, which will leave Pipkin without many reps. A practice squad year feels likely.\ngrade: C-\n\n* Congratulations, you have fulfilled your mandated and filled your depth chart:\n1) Deshaun Watson\n2) Landry Jones\n3) Christian Ponder\nFA money spent: $9 million\nDraft picks spent: R1 (#2 overall)\nDabo Swinney and Clemson basically anointed Deshaun Watson as the face of their program ever since he stepped on campus, and you're doing a similar thing here in San Francisco. Watson will immediately jump in as the starter, as neither Landry Jones or Christian Ponder can represent a strong enough challenge to a #2 pick.\nAnd that may be okay. After all, Watson has 3 years of starting experience at Clemson, not to mention a confidence and swagger that shouldn't be broken by some early season struggles.\nYour backups won't move the needle much. In fact, Landry Jones may be disgruntled. He came to this city to compete for a starting job, not play caddy to some franchise golden boy. On the other hand, Christian Ponder should actually help out Watson's development -- he's a smart veteran who can help out in the QB room, and won't have any bitterness or expectations to start.\ngrade: B\n\n* Congratulations, you have fulfilled your mandated and filled your depth chart:\n1) Matt Barkley\n2) Jerod Evans\n3) Antonio Pipkin\nFA money spent: $9 million\nDraft picks spent: R2\nDrafting Jerod Evans in R2 shows that you don't have much faith in starter Matt Barkley. But for this depth chart to succeed, Matt Barkley will have to succeed - at least, to some degree.\nAfter all, Evans is a one-year starter who's raw -- coming from a QB-friendly spread system that made Paxton Lynch look like a star. We all saw how Lynch looked as a rookie, and it wouldn't be a stretch to presume Evans may struggle the same way. Obviously, Tiffin rookie Antonio Pipkin isn't ready for prime time either.\nAll that means is: Barkley needs to hold down the fort, as long as possible. If he can last 8+ games, that may give you enough time to develop Jerod Evans. Anything less would amount to throwing Evans to the wolves, which may ruin his confidence and completely ruin your plan here.\nOnce Jerod Evans gets his feet settled, the idea of him backed up by Barley makes sense. But there will be waves getting there, and a lot of risk with this chart.\ngrade: C\n"}

Obviously Cousins' strengths seem a lot more transcendent then Kap's but that's why I'm worried about pulling the trigger on Cousins, limited production, which might be a bit stupid. Also he has a very good skill position players at each level and a stellar O-Line in Washington, and Gruden's offence is great.

Only your OEM can send you an OTA update.)  \nOEM = original equipment manufacturer (the company that made your phone; here, OnePlus. Other examples are Samsung, LG, Motorola, etc.)\n\nAll the phones that use this particular \"system-on-a-chip\", the Snapdragon 801, are suspiciously stuck on Marshmallow. Not a single one got a Nougat update, even the ones released nearly a year apart. That's because, for each Android update, first the SoC needs to get updated first. That SoC update is called a \"BSP\", the broad support package. If your SoC doesn't get that update...no way you'll get an official Android update.\n\nYou can hack around that and still make the SoC work with new versions of Android with the older BSPs. But that hack is not good enough for Google's stringent ROM tests. Google does not give permission for anyone to include Google Play Store on any phone with any ROM that has not passed Google's stringent ROM tests (these tests are collectively known as Google's Compatibility Test Suite). While technically the ROMs \"work\" with the Play Store, they don't have Google's blessing.\n\nSo, instead, custom ROM developers found a workaround. They don't provide the Google Play Store in their ROM. Download any custom ROM and you'll never get the Google Play Store. You yourself can \"break\" the Google agreement by adding the Google Play Store, but no developer is going to risk that. Essentially, every custom ROM user installs GApps and many developers will give links to where you can download them. But, they will not bundle it inside the ROM because that's violating Google's agreement and no developer wants to get on the bad side of Google like that."}

And I say this as someone who uses both Apple and Google products and is typing this comment on a Mac, after watching Sling on my Apple TV and surfing my iPad.  The only Android devices in our home are our phones, chromecasts and TV.\n\nCustom hardware for gimmicks is pointless.  I'd rather have a universal back button than Force Touch.  You might consider that innovation.  It's rather meh for a lot of people including me.\n\nAnd Lightning? Are you kidding me?  Another excuse to rob iOS users.  Why didn't they go with USB-C like they did on the new Macs?\n\nHere's my prediction.  In two years, USB-C will be the universal standard on everything except the iPhone.  And it'll still be only the most hardcore fans who think Force Touch is more than a gimmick.\n\nNote.  I've never said the Pixel is on par with the iPhone yet. I've said the gap will be closing.  And it will.  There's really not much more hardware innovations to be had.  Better camera? Sure.  But both sides are now hitting the limits of optics on a device of handheld proportions.  Durability?  Sure.  And it's likely the Pixel 2 will see IP68.  So what's left, marginal improvements in processor speed, displays and battery life that will all be largely imperceptible to the average user.\n\nThe innovation is all in software.  And guess what?  Cloud services matter.  Biggest reason for getting my wife a pixel and not a cheaper phone?  Camera and unlimited Photos storage.  We just had a baby.  And the new mom wants tons of pics and videos backed up.  You can do the math and tell me what that would cost on iOS.\n\nI'd consider full migration to Apple if they were actually willing to let me avoid a monthly bill with equivalent services.  Everytime I think of moving Google's services are what keep me on their ecosystem.  Moreover, Apple has a way of purposely avoiding standards just to cost me money.  I can add functionality to old TVs with cheap chromecasts.  I can have music throughout the house with old speakers and cheap Chromecast audio.  My new TV has Cast built-in.  Super easy to teach my tech challenged spouse to use too.  Heck, even the Nest I installed integrates with the Google Home app.  With Apple?  No choice for audio.  And i have to buy a super expensive Apple TV for each TV set (the one I have atm was complimentary from Sling....).  \n\nAnd in the end, this is what will hobble Apple.  The trend is for more built-in functionality that \"just works\" with all my stuff.  Apple seems to have lost that bit of their DNA with Steve Jobs.  I find myself actually pondering if someday a Chromebook might replace my Macbook Pro after I'm out of grad school.  Just because of ecosystem integration...."}

There would need to be a galaxy app store no matter what and it makes things a lot easier for us when we're handling so much stuff that is more specific than Google play is designed for. Then there are apps like disconnect pro that wouldn't be allowed on the Google play store even if it would work on native android.\n\n&gt;Samsung uses Android therefore Android is capable of doing everything Samsung does but someone has to code the features.\n\nLOL. What? No way. That's ridiculously untrue. Good lock? Disconnect pro? Thumbjam? AmpliTube? The play store has a version of AmpliTube for native android too but it requires a pricey USB audio processor called the iRig UA to handle the audio processing to make up for Androids inability to handle the processing. \n\n&gt;All apps in the Galaxy store could be on the Play Store too, they are just APKs.\n\nNot all of them. There are also plugins, system ui updates and mods, camera filters etc. And as far as the apps themselves they wouldn't even be compatible. I already brought up all the iOS exclusive ports. Native Android can't handle those at all. \n\n&gt;FYI you know now Knox is developed with Google and Blackberry beside Samsung right. \n\nThat's funny. Then why is Google a licensee of it? And why is the version they licensed so limited?

Not sure how well it holds up today.\n\nI'm not aware of what's out there for smaller phones under $200, but if you don't mind getting something a bit more expensive, here's my two cents:\n\nIf you want to keep buying Apple, there's the iPhone SE or iPhone 6. SE is 4 inches, close to her current 3.5'' phone, while iPhone 6 is 4.7''. \n\nFor Android, I don't think there's anything quite as small as SE. At 4.7 inches (which, to me, is about the ideal phone size) you have Samsung Galaxy A3 at a slightly higher price range than the 3s or the Sony Xperia X Compact at a significantly higher price range. \n\nI also prefer smaller phones and there's not a whole lot of options right now, but the phones above and the others from Xperia compact line (Z3C if you can get a hold of a new one, which would probably be cheaper, and Z5C) should be all solid.

{"cat": "science_and_technology", "txt": "nah, there's a good dozen countries where unlimited sms is part of carrier service, but data is limited and/or costs extra. There are plenty where data coverage is still spotty and slow, but the sms is reliable.\n\nDig through all the crap when this subject comes up. You see Australians, multiple south American countries, Canada, the US, and occasional European countries chime in to say that sms is the cheaper method there. Of course I can't verify since I don't live in those places, but why would people from there randomly lie?\n\nAnd it completely ignores the fractured messaging ecosystem. Whatsap and Facebook are the big two, but telegram, wire, and several others are in the mix. So you have people bitching about no sms fallback, people bitching about the hassles of having to use multiple messenger services, and people just bitching for the fun of it.\n\nThe point is that, like it or not, there's going to be some kind of common standard that's built into the carriers. Currently is sms/mms with all the flaws inherent in them. If there isn't some kind of base standard, then any non voice communication becomes reliant on who's using what service. And that defeats the purpose of texting completely. The ability to send brief written messages is core to what made portable phones (originally these giant radios, eventually the more svelte flip phones and now our touch screen smart phones) so damn useful.\n\nIt's not like you couldn't just find a phone in most non rural areas with a five minute walk. Cell phones were about convenience, being able to be reached when you weren't home or in the office. Texting was laid over that and turned portables from a convenience into an ubiquitous and necessary thing.\n\nSo just carping \"U.S. Only\" about sms/messaging debates is just empty rhetoric (that's also inaccurate). It does nothing to address the basic reason for messaging in the first place, a universal method of rapid communication. Until and unless a single IM service becomes built into the carrier system, they're all second place because they're limited to whoever chooses them.\n\nAnd, as everyone I communicate with on a personal level knows, I'm never going to use whatsapp, Facebook messenger, or any similar service just because it's in the majority. Majority isn't good enough for a primary messaging method. \n\nIt'd be real nice to have something like one of the services that will also reach everyone,, even if they dont use it. It'll happen eventually, and it looks like RCS is going to be the next step towards that. If RCS does become universal as a standard (more particularly the Google/jibe version), then you'll have the ability to use whatever service you want, with rcs as a backup. And that is the point of texting, that it can reach everyone using a cellular device."}

Yes, Samsung phones do have additional software and it is not completely unrealistic to expect that they'll take longer. But when you launch the update for phones on network, why can't you release them for the unlocked variants?\n\nTech Media *were* biased but if you look at most of their recommendations for a new phone, they say 'S7'.\n\nMy point was that you turned something about the S7 into a completely unrelated topic about the Pixel **which no one mentioned here and proceeded to bash it**. Thereby being hypocritical as you call the media out for doing the same.\n\nI'm not saying anything about bad about Samsung's software features. Hey, if you care about audio quality more than the average consumer- that's perfect. There's a phone brand for you.\n\n&gt;Google just talks about things it wants to do and hopes others figure it out and get it done for them.\n\nNot going to lie, Google does copy ideas from skins and take them in.

{"cat": "science_and_technology", "txt": "&gt;because it's made by Google it's the best design choice\n\nHah, hardly. The Pixel's design is just as bad as every other current smartphone. The last phone I've used with a decent physical design was the Moto X 2013. Everything else just uses the same squat flat slab, often with pointless fragile glass jammed into the back for no reason.\n\nI'm fine with thinner bezels (my Z3C/Z5C had it about right, maybe slightly too thin), but the S8 takes it so far past practical it's basically a joke - the curved edges just make it even worse, since they serve no purpose except to get in the way and make it more fragile.\n\nIn any case, the biggest issue is still the size. 5.8\" is just too big to use one-handed effectively, bezels or no. If you kept my Pixel the same total size and just upped the screen like they did with the S8, it'd be almost unusable. I'd love for the Pixel 2 to have smaller bezels but if they bump the screen size to do it I won't be interested.\n\nPlus there's battery to consider - with a given size frame, there's only so much room for battery, so if you just ramp up the screen size and don't make it thicker (and the manufacturer's seem hellbent on doing the opposite), the battery life is going to go down. The S8 only has a 3000mAh battery for a 5.8\" screen - that's going to be a problem."}

I came to the S7 from an OG Moto X. The AoD on that phone is the gold standard dammit. Beautiful UI, smooth, and intuitive. The Samsung verision (imo) is a lot uglier (literally the aesthetic of the displayed info, how it unlocks, etc) and is still limited by the number of apps it works with (I don't think it works with Textra or WhatApp currently). \n\nThe rest of the list is a bunch of nifty rare-usage features and while nice to have simply don't make up for the very meh implementation of the common ones I use.

It's because it goes through a lot more development, optimization and gains more powerful capabilties. That's how the S7 beats the pixel in capabilties, battery life and is just as snappy albeit with more frame drops. For every animation frame drop we get an extra percentage of battery and another capability that's extensive enough to replace thousand dollar gear we'd otherwise have enough buy.\n\nCheck out the version of AmpliTube we get. It just works and great at that. And we get so many more exclusive apps like that, some of which are even ported from iOS exclusively to the galaxy app store. The version of AmpliTube the pixel gets requires you to buy a pricey USB external device to handle the audio processing since the pixel isn't nearly as optimized. Look at the app optimizer and the split screen function touchwiz already has on marshmallow, they both work better, plus all the features other nougat devices don't even have yet. The pixel added a similar thing to the app optimizer to their version of nougat and it works horribly. You can't even override it if it doesn't do what you want. \n\nMy point is that if people knew why the updates take a bit longer no one would be mad. For all we get for the extra few months Im surprised it doesn't take longer.   \n\nThe pixel is the target because its first to get updates but also has the most problems out of all devices. That'd a side of the picture people don't realize. It is also the most limited in terms of capabilties which is obvious but a lot of people don't think of that either. \n\nYou can either have a further developed and optimized version of Android or a quicker version of Android.

{"cat": "science_and_technology", "txt": "There are still some things that make it so not every smartphone is worth pursuing equally.\n\nThe first is that some installs are easier to get than others. It's relatively easy for Snapchat to get more installs by catering to the demographic of American high school and college students. In contrast, Snapchat wouldn't get nearly as many installs if they focused on the American nursing home demographic. The South American fishing village demographic might be a difficult one to expand to as well. Expending the effort required to optimize your app for a phone that's common in South American fishing villages isn't going to provide the same pay off as directing that effort towards optimizing for a phone that's common in American high schools.\n\nSecond, not every user is equal contributor to your revenue. If most of Snapchat's revenue comes from people viewing sponsored stories in the English language, then an install from somebody who speaks English is more valuable than an install from somebody who doesn't.\n\nAnd lastly, somebody who uses the app frequently (e.g. somebody who is interested in doing that sort of thing and who has the data to send/receive Snaps away from WiFi) is better to pursue than somebody who wouldn't use it as much. Those heavy users will provide more revenue (through purchases or viewing sponsored content), and they will do more to attract and keep other users."}

It is having multiple apps that fragment users.  Allo doesn't really play nice with anything else.  I avoid Facebook and Facebook Messenger because they tend to hog resources.  But aside from that poor optimization, Facebook has done well with 2 apps.  And it is because they don't add extra hoops to jump through with things different accounts.  \n\nGoogle, on the other hand, is adding apps and none of them work well together.  To use a buzzword, there is no synergy to using Allo, Duo, Hangouts, Messenger, and Voice.  Each one works separately (aside from Hangouts and Voice).

WhatsApp has over a billion users who have registering with their phone numbers. Facebook has a billion users who have registered with their email address.

My car insurance has had an old card number for 3 years and it has even been expired for over a year now, and every 90 days the payment still comes out.

I'd just say try it and see. \n\nThe version I'd use is ViPER4Android FX 2.5.0.5, as that is the newest version of the main V4A app (older official variants have been decommissioned and rolled into FX). If you're willing to wait a bit to get a current, XDA has a bunch of different \"materialized\" versions of V4A that make the UI look nicer. Be careful if you go that route because sometimes they also pack in other audio processing libs and it just trashes the sound. The trick with V4A is to make slight adjustments to color the sound the way you want it. Going too heavy can sound good at first but really ruin the actual quality of the sound. "}

It's absurd.\n\nThis is about the person on the other end as much as (or more than) it's about you. When you had merged conversations it looked convenient and simple to bounce between Hangouts and SMS. But if the person on the other end doesn't have the same merging (because they're on iOS, or because they only use Hangouts from a computer, or because they use Hangouts on Android but they use a different app for SMS) it's a nuisance for them. They have to bounce between two different apps (or devices) to see what looks like a single conversation on your end. They might even have to open a message in one app and then reply in a different app.\n\nIf you have something like iMessage or RCS that knows that the person on the other end has the same merging you do, then merging is great. But if you can only merge on one end and not the other, you're presenting something convenient to one person while presenting something annoying to the other."}

Also, with most Android changes that I dislike, I can usually still understand why Google might have thought they were good. This isn't one of those.\n\n\n\nPeople had to intentionally snoop before.

For any situation where a normal phone couldn't compete, the note 7 already had a backup plan in place. Some of these will overlap with the S7, but not all of them:\n\n* PoS terminal doesn't accept NFC? That's ok, you can pay with magnets\n\n* Wearing gloves and can't interact with the screen? That's ok, just use your S pen instead\n\n* still wearing gloves and can't scan your fingerprint? That's ok, just scan your fucking eyes you crazy bastard\n\n* dropped your phone in water? That's ok, just wipe it dry and put it back in your pocket\n\n* USB-C port being an asshole? That's ok, you can charge your phone by setting it on top of a circle.\n\n* run out of space for your pictures? That's ok, just pop a micro SD in there\n\n* want to keep all of your porn a secret? Just lock it inside a Knox environment that requires your eyes to open\n\n...\n\nI think that about covers everything. Of course the S7 hits most of these points, but it's still not the same. The S7 edge is shaped wrong, the baller software that came with the S pen is missing, and the metal sides are the wrong fucking color.\n\nI would buy a note 7 at full price without hesitation if it officially became available again.

They look great on all kinds of backgrounds.\n\nThe icons were originally developed for jailbroken iOS devices but have become popular in the android theming community, specifically /r/androidthemes.\n\nSeeing the demands for the icons and using them myself, I approached Colby and began discussing porting them to android. We came to an agreement, and I began work on the app.\n\nFast forward to today, I have the app design solidified, I have made a website and a mailing list, and am in the nitty gritty of renaming all the icons and plugging them into the app.\n\nAt the moment there is no ETA for the app. I am a student and I have other commitments that take time, so it is very hard to find time to work on it. At the moment, the app is going to cost $1.99. That said, the price is subject to change before and during the release\n\nIf you would like to assist me in naming icons and doing boring work, you can PM me with your hangouts email address and we can talk.\n\nAlso, Colby will be answering questions along with me, so please give him as much respect as you would give me, because he has as much authority as me.

The 'time saved' number is not decremented when going below the speed limit since you may be stuck in traffic, in bad weather, etc. It only counts when you make the choice to drive over the speed limit.\n\nFactoring in timed lights would be an interesting exercise though I suspect it's a hard problem to solve. I could maybe find out if the road you're on has lights. Then if there is a pattern of you speeding, then slowing (or stopping) near intersections assume that you're dealing with timed lights.

I'm simply explaining the reason why people are comparing other numbers.\n\nSamsung's market share may have dropped, so it's logical to ask \"How are their other numbers looking right now?\" because market share is NOT the end-all be-all of a company. If their profit share went up, while market share dropped, for example, then you could say the entire article is making a big deal out of nothing, etc etc. If their profit margins went up, but profits went down, but market share is also down, we can say they're doing less work to earn the same money... and so on. Looking at other numbers can tell you a hell lot more.\n\nIt's called examining things from different angles, and is definitely **still on topic.** The fact that those other numbers don't look too good either is just making the downvote happy fanboys very angry.

{"cat": "science_and_technology", "txt": "Very few people, especially those writing the articles, are any good at explaining RCS, because RCS itself isn't just one thing. Using the same term for so many different things is why any discussion about RCS on this reddit is just a huge headache, and why any articles written about it have to be taken with an immense grain of salt. But, here's the broad basics:\n\n* RCS is a messaging protocol. It can be thought of as the evolution of SMS/MMS. \n\n* It allows larger file sizes for attachments (10 mb vs the typical 300-600 kb mms will allow on a given carrier).\n\n* It allows for read receipts. SMS/MMS already allowed for delivery reports, so while that's often touted as a new feature, it isn't. Just the read receipts are. \n\n* It allows you to see when another person in your conversation is typing (and vice versa), as long as you're both using the same version of RCS. \n\n* It's backwards compatible with SMS/MMS, so will fallback on those as needed. \n\nNow, this is where it gets \"confusing\":\n\n* There are carrier specific versions of RCS. Carrier specific versions only use RCS features when texting people on your carrier using a supported device. Most carriers in the USA have a carrier specific implementation of RCS, but don't call it RCS. They use less eggheaded terms (but not necessarily better) such as Advanced Messaging (what AT&amp;T calls it). To use the carrier specific version of RCS, you have to use the messaging app that supports it, and for almost any carrier, that's the stock messaging app on your phone. \n\n* There is a universal version of RCS. It isn't supported by virtually any carrier in the USA, so calling it \"universal\" is kind of silly to begin with. The dream is that one day this universal version will be as standard as SMS/MMS. That's been a dream for years though, so...well, the cynic might roll their eyes, especially considering the direction American carriers have gone. \n\n* The Google blog post is filled with fairy fluff and sunflowers regarding the \"universal\" standard. It acts like it's got zillions of people who'll be on and using this universal standard, while ignoring that virtually all of America will not, and it's the Americans who still message primarily via SMS/MMS, and many of those \"billions\" it will support do NOT use SMS/MMS, since they're from countries who charge for such messages. \n\nNow, all that said, even a carrier specific version of RCS is better than nothing. \n\n"}

I was a big OLED fan when the tech first came out, but I will no longer touch anything with it due to the issues. You can look at my comment history on r/Android and a few other subs to see more details of why I dislike the tech. Oh, and I'm not basing this off an outdated opinion either. My girlfriend currently has an S7, which already has burn in after about 6 months of use, if you know what to look for. Of course, if you don't know what to look for, you'll miss it entirely, but when you go look at that brand new S8 on display, you'll think \"wow, they improved the display so much!\" when in reality, it's the same display, just yours has degraded.\n\n/u/diagonali I'm actually surprised to see others with the same opinion. I've stated it many times in the past and usually get heavily downvoted. As you said, LCDs have improved tremendously in recent times. The only real benefit to OLED now is black levels. Otherwise, LCDs now match or surpass them in terms of viewing angles, colour gamut, outdoor visibility, etc. All without having issues with blue pixel deterioration, burn in, white point shift, etc. The rumours of Apple moving to OLED really worry me, even though I've guessed this would eventually happen. The unfortunate truth is that most consumers use OLED as a buzz word. If a new phone doesn't have OLED, it's automatically inferior, even if it objectively has better outdoor visibility, better calibration in terms of gamma and white point, better colour gamut, etc. None of that will matter to the average consumer, because it isn't OLED. Apple moving to OLED is going to ruin people's already flawed perception of LCDs, and phone manufacturers will find it nearly impossible to sell a flagship phone with an LCD. This is the unfortunate truth. The fact is, OLED is a flawed technology with built in planned obsolescence. I can only hope I'm overestimating the average consumer's stupidity and that manufacturers like Sony and others will stick to high quality LCD panels or that MicroLED (or any other self illuminated inorganic display tech) technology is mass produced and becomes a viable alternative. Otherwise, we're going to be seeing a lot of splotchy screens, burn in, and people constantly talking about how new phones have much more amazing screens, when in reality, they are holding a rapidly degrading piece of junk.

Some people don't trust SuperSU because it is closed source so you can't really be sure exactly what you are installing on your phone. Magisk is completely open source (as far as I know) so some people will choose it over SuperSU for that reason alone.\n\nMagisk is also able to modify any file on your phone without touching the system partition. It works somewhat like Xposed but it can make much deeper modifications to your phone.

Should I give a dim about that? No! I don't even need to use the Free Version because I can download the Paid Version! Even that G.Store background checking can be avoided by tweaking the application, making it think you are always offline! It's that easy!\n\n\nAdditionally... Something you might not have known is that someone using the Free Version daily will end up providing the developer more money than someone who bought the application. It takes a few months, but it's true. And here's where the greediness comes in! After the application reaches its peak of sold copies, it starts slowing down.. a lot! That's normal, since each user buys the application once! But! Ad revenue never stops! It goes on and on and on, till the user stops using the free application! It's much more profitable for the developer if the Free Application has 2k users, than if it sold 2k times.\n\nThat's why he added more ads! Because it would increase the ad revenue by at least 1/3 of the current amount. But once people uninstalled the application, he lost tons of ad revenue! That's why he deleted the extra ads!"}

If you've thought the sound on your previous phones wasn't great then you'll really benefit. If not, don't worry about it.  \nI have an external USB DAC that I use with my phone and the difference is clearly audible with half decent earphones or other audio equipment that uses the jack.\n\nA DAC is a digital-to-analogue converter; it's responsible for changing the digital sound data stored on your phone into the analogue current that comes out of your headphone jack. The better the DAC, the lower the noisefloor (the noise/hiss you hear during playback), the lower the crosstalk (the separation of sounds on the L and R channel, which helps with the stereo image, or where you perceive the sounds coming from around your head), along with all the other obvious improvements like dynamics and clarity.\n  One note - don't confuse the DAC with the Amplifier. The amp amplifies that now analogue current in order to produce volume and better drive higher impedance (bigger) headphones. You need both to get good sound. Generally companies upgrade both DAC and amp when they're making a point about this kind of thing, as LG has done in the past."}

Right now a lot of people tend to not charge their phone while they sleep and just charge it up after they wake up. Quick charging has really allowed a more relaxed lifestyle when it comes to charging. Having your phone go from 40% to 100% in under an hour makes the idea of charging more flexible. Do you want to charge your phone on the way to work? Do you have a battery pack with quick charge? Do you top it off during lunch? Quick charge makes so many useful options available that slow charging couldn't. Charging for 30 minutes before yielded very little in return on your battery that people never utilized it. Now 30 minutes of charging gets you a few more hours of phone use. Wireless charging was perfect for the old way of charging. It just lost out to ease of conformity in a persons daily schedule. "}

This permanently locks the phone to the Gmail account, unless intentionally disabled. If you factory reset the phone for any reason, it will require you to enter the credentials for the original Gmail account or the phone will not work. If you enter the incorrect credentials too many times in a row (I believe it's 10 or so), the phone will lock for 3 days, after which you can try again. It is *not* a three day timer to an unlocked phone, *you still need the original credentials*. \n\nIf your phone is stolen or lost, and the new de facto owner tries to use the phone they will likely reset it (assuming you had some kind of security enabled like a pin, pattern, or fingerprint) but during the setup, it will *force* them to enter the original email credentials. If they unable to provide that the phone locks for 3 days. \n\nBasically, device protection is like your phone imprinting to your Gmail.

It isn't like all iPhones or iPads have capable digitizers.  Looking at the link you gave to adonit, the Pixel uses Bluetooth for some of its features.  \n\n&gt; Pixel will work just like your finger on any capacitive touch screen device. Features like pressure sensitivity, palm-rejection, Pixelpoint technology, and use of shortcut buttons require an iOS device with Bluetooth 4.0.  \n\n^ From the [FAQ](http://www.adonit.net/support/pixel/).\n\n&gt; Reason why there are more for ipad is the same as reason why there are more accessories for iphone then any other phone.\n\nI would think that would explain why there are more on iOS, but not why there are literally zero.  OP asked about pressure sensitive styli, which to the best of my knowledge the only option on Android is to buy an S-Pen capable device.  On iOS it looks like if you have anything from the iPhone 4 on you can buy that Pixel stylus.  There are other options for iOS as well outside of the Apple Pencil with pressure sensitivity and things like that.  \n\nI would think the reasoning that more don't exist would be that Android didn't natively support Bluetooth styli until Marshmallow.  And that today only accounts for ~32% of all Android phones have Marshmallow or higher.   Perhaps they plan on working on Android in the future but they just haven't gotten around to it.  Or perhaps the numbers on Android tablet sales are low since a big portion of the stylus customers are likely going to be tablet owners.  It looks like about 4% of all Android devices are Tablet sized.  \n\n[Source for both 32% market share and 4% tablet sized devices](https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html)\n\n"}

It's just another data only messaging app like KIK and WeChat and any other apps that don't rely on a mobile network. \nMessenger is fine as it is, now that it's RCS usable. It's a simple messaging app that 90% of the 90% Android market would use...In countries where they don't rely on tradition cell phone towers you see in North America they would us Allo or WhatsApp or those other apps. \nMy thoughts boil down to this. They took too long to build a viable app for Android and market the hell out of it. Hangouts is getting crippled. It's just Google's way and it's annoying as fuck!  \n1. Build an app  \n2. Small user base.  \n3. Add some flair.  \n4. Lose momentum.  \n5. Build alternative app.  \n6. Discontinue old app.  \n7. ???  \n8. Google profits, user suffers.  \nYou're asking the wrong people here...We (the majority who are not Googlers and developers) at r/Android have NO say in what Google does. So your solution, does nothing except boost our own sense of purpose of trying to come up with solution to people who don't give a fuck! (See Justin Uberti). \n  \nSee you in 3 days when another user has a solution!"}

But yeah it had loads and loads of issues such as the GPS and random reboots, especially the battery life. However when I discovered Cyanogenmod for it, it was like having a brand new phone. Besides that though, recently I've owned an HTC Desire 626s and to me it was just pretty low end and I kept running out of space it was just a terrible experience overall and not any custom roms that I know of. Luckily it did have TWRP so I was able to make it a little better with root and xposed framework. I've owned that garbage because before that I had a OnePlus One and I've broke and lost it. To me, the One was the best device I've owned besides the Nexus 5. Now I own a OnePlus Two and it's pretty good.

{"cat": "science_and_technology", "txt": "It's not hard to find. [Windows has a 10-year lifecycle on OSes](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13853/windows-lifecycle-fact-sheet), so you're not running the same version for 15 years, and aside from the past couple releases (7 &gt; 8 &gt; 8.1 &gt; 10), the performance demands almost always go up with a new release of Windows.\n\nNow, of course, you don't *have* to run the most current version, just one that's less than 10 years old. But, handily enough, I actually have a couple computers that are 11 years old right here in my office, and I've played around with them a bit over the years. They're a good enough proxy for 15 year-old computers.\n\nThey barely run Windows XP, and trying Vista on them was a nightmare. Windows 7 was right out of the question.\n\nOn the other hand, I did grab one of these machines (one of the few spare computers we had at the time I started here) and use it to build our low-volume helpdesk server (LAMP + osTicket). It's still happily running in that capacity four years later, and I've barely had to touch the thing aside from the occasional reboot for kernel updates. Only reason I'm going to need to do any work on it soon is that it's running Ubuntu 12.04, and that hits end of life this summer. These machines also run Ubuntu with a low-resource GUI with some competency, which is more than you can say for their Windows performance.\n\nNow that's just anecdotal, of course, but part of my point is that I don't think you have any realistic idea of what using a 15 year old computer is like. It's definitely not going to be running Vista (or Windows server 2008) in any kind of reasonable or useful way, and those are the oldest versions of Windows that are currently supported \u2014 though not for much longer, as Vista turns into a pumpkin here in 55 days."}

Come on, that's a link from my earlier link under \"You should also read...\", it's like you're not even trying to inform yourself of how permissions work on Android 6.0+.\n\nAlso since it's clear you're not a dev (or at least one who's never attempted to use the 6.0+ permissions system), and since you're not reading the links I'm sending you, I guess you'll only learn from my comments themselves. \n\nPre-Android 6.0, permissions were granted automatically at install time, no matter what. The app wants your location? Granted. Contacts? Granted. There was basically no way around it, if an app wanted your lifestory and pictures of it, they had access to it once you installed the app.\n\nAndroid 6.0 changed all that. If devs built their app against 6.0, all of a sudden dangerous permissions (I'll get to what's \"dangerous\" in a minute) were no longer auto-granted at install time, they had to be approved as you use the app and the app had to explicitly ask the user for this approval. No longer could an app just have instant access to your contacts/location/phone records/etc. unless it asked you for them. This is how the 6.0 permissions model works.  \n\nThere are two types of permissions: normal and dangerous. Dangerous permissions are the following (and can be changed at any time in future versions of Android):  \n\n* Viewing/editing your personal calendar\n* Access to your camera\n* Viewing/editing your contact list and getting a list of your linked email accounts\n* Access to your location\n* Access to your microphone\n* Just about anything regarding voice calls (call logs, making phone calls, processing outgoing calls, voicemail, etc.)\n* Access to body sensors (i.e. heart rate sensor)\n* Anything to do with SMS (sending/receiving texts, reading texts, etc.)\n* Reading/writing to external storage  \n\nIf an app wanted any of the above, it had to ask you (using an unalterable system prompt, to avoid deception or fake \"popups\") and you can either grant or deny the permission. Anything _not_ listed above are what are considered \"normal\" permissions, things like access to the internet, Bluetooth, NFC, setting an alarm, usage of the fingerprint sensor, vibration, etc. These permissions are still auto-granted at install time and cannot be revoked later by you the user.\n\nIt seems that your thoughts on this permissions model are based on I guess news stories and \"Android marketing\" rather than actually knowing how it works on a technical level, and I hope this comment gives you a better understanding of how the 6.0+ permissions model works.

Same thing with OnePlus. \n\nWhile this seems to be the argument the video author is making, I firmly believe he is completely and totally wrong.  Pebble was under pressure from its investors to grow, so it tried to grow.  \n\nMy firm belief is that had Pebble *not* invested resources in expanding towards the mass market and kept their staff small and overhead low, they could still be a vibrant, though smallish independent company.\n\nStaying small - not over expanding - providing specialized products to a small customer base.  It's a tried and true business model that has worked for centuries.  Though it's easy to see why it's not the most popular vision within Pebble's home base of silicon valley.\n\nPebble didn't do that.  They hired hundreds.  They expanded into markets outside their core.  They made an expensive mass market push. They failed.\n\nMuch of this drive may have been due to the venture capital culture that funded the business.  Whatever the rationale for their over expansion, they clearly over expanded."}

{"cat": "science_and_technology", "txt": "Our games have open player-run economies. A doomsday scenario would be a large number of players making a large number of IAPs, flooding the market, and trading these IAPs to unknowing players. It would do the same thing to our economy as if the Fed decided to print a bunch of extra money, and it would most certainly affect currency conversion rates. I suppose you could use a \"counterfeit\" analogy, too. What would happen if 30% of the money in our economy turned out to be counterfeit?\n\nPotentially just as bad would be someone selling these IAPs on the secondary \"black market\" for $USD. \n\nWe have the tools to track these transactions, and in the past we've had to reverse / recoup in-game trades in cases of chargebacks (which always causes CS issues). \n\nA year ago we had someone using stolen credit cards to make IAPs. They then sold those IAPs to other players on the secondary market using PayPal. It was thousands and thousands of dollars. We had to reverse all of the trades and transactions those players did, and they were out whatever $ they sent to the asshole on PayPal. In a few cases we ended up having to completely destroy some long-term player's accounts to recoup losses from the fraud. For them it was certainly a lesson about secondary market transactions with anonymous strangers over the internet.\n\nGoogle's new API will let us know when someone does a refund, and we'll be able to auto-ban their accounts, but since they can use/trade the IAPs before doing the refund, that's a problem. Hopefully Google will have their eye out for people doing abusive refund requests.\n\n"}

If you could find one article or source where either apple or Samsung admitted to leaking the entire phone and not just small features (headphone jack), then I'd believe it. \n\nNot every leak is apart of marketing strategy. If you read steve jobs book, some things are definitely leaked, usually through mainstream channels and some are not (iphone 4 fiasco)\n\nMovies, games music are leaked but most of the time not by the people actually making it. Why would they spend so much time with DRM which usually causes public backlash? Just because they get marketing attention and it seems like a good thing, doesn't mean it was intentional. The website who leaks the info and Chinese manufacturer employee benefits a lot from leaks which is why there is such a big market for smuggling smartphone details out. \n\nGizmodo got a ton of press for the iphone 4 leak and apple was pissed.

A lot of folks don't need two sims so it works out fine for them and for the folks that do need it and also want more storage space, the manufacturers get to make more $$$ from selling them a higher storage tier than giving them the third slot. This adapter is thin enough to still make contact with the second sim pins in the hybrid slot while the pins on the microSD can still make contact with the reader in the phone. It's been working 100% for me and the folks that I learned about this adapter from (In the Mi Max XDA forum) and also works in my redmi note 3 but it is essential just a work around that forces two slots to become one.
