He hardly has he track record of someone trying to railroad workers for corporate interests so there must have been something he felt was hugely important to use so much political capital on something like TPP. \n\nMaybe TPP could have been better (it certainly seems so) yet maybe it was the best Obama could manage given the many and varied interests at play. However it does seem that it would have been in the US strategic interest and if we not only throw it out but begin a significant withdrawal from foreign markets that China will definitely move to fill the void. \n\nSo we may very well be looking at the end of Western economic hegemony with the election of Trump and the ascendency of other nationalistic movements in Britain, France and elsewhere. \n\nWhat's so sad is that it appears to be entirely self-inflicted. There is nothing forcing the retraction of the developed democracies, it seems to simply be the result of myopic reactions to globalism."}

Research has shown that a person who was witness to an event will subconsciously rewrite what they saw based on what they hear other people say. \n\nThis combined with one tweet (honestly, twitter is a double edged sword when it comes to from the scene news) that said a chair was thrown (sent by someone who saw the chair picked up and heard someone yell something about a chair, and just subconsciously assumed it would be or was thrown), means most people's first impressions of the event was that Bernie supporters were upset (true), and became violent (not true, but easy to see how in the heat of the moment, people there would be feeling it was or was becoming violent).\n\nUnfortunately, humans tend to accept the first information they receive about an event as the real truth, and any info contrary to the first info tends to get disregarded, while info that agrees in some way is accepted.\n\nTV news channel media is not and never has been trustworthy. While it tends towards the truth, due to the pressure for ratings to keep eyeballs, TV media will play up the outrageous aspects if there is a shred of truth to it. Best I can tell, the violent Bernie convention narrative began with TV news media. This meant the people editing content had an incentive (better TV ratings for more ad revenue) to cut the only video showing the chair with the guy putting it down. Instead, they cut it short right before he puts it down.\n\nAll in all, a lot of these narratives (including the Bernie bros one) come out of our need for 24/7 info, which encourages our news media to try and be the first on the scene info wise, which means they rely on less than reliable sources. People then codify in their minds that initial information which wasn't accurate, and disbelieve the follow up information which clarifies and corrects the initial info dump.\n\nAlso, due to social media, those fringe supporters need to be shut down by regular supporters immediately, and not just dismissed as fringe supporters, because as we've seen, they can become a huge liability in politics (being used to paint the whole group in a bad light). If not, they can be allowed to fester and develop into a toxic tumor on the campaign, as we've seen with a few Trump supporters (who definitely aren't the majority of his supporters)"}

{"con": 0, "txt": "&gt; So, once again, if someone said\n\n&gt; I think X-Gate is real, because of: X, Y, and Z reasons\n\n&gt; but, someone responded with only: That's fake news. You're damn right it's a talking point. \n\nFirst, that isn't what happened.  Someone just said pizzagate, someone else that story is fake news, you jumped ugly.  There was no detailed defense of why pizzagate is a real thing only to be brushed off with a \"fake news\" retort.  \n\nSecond, that's still not a talking point.  Maybe you should define what you think a talking point is because it seems the be the root of your issue.  Regardless, the term \"fake news\" represents a real thing.  So unless you want to defend pizzagate specifically as a real thing and not an example of fake news, someone bringing it up and someone saying it is the thing the phrase represents... that's not a talking point.  Again, that's just using the new phrase.\n\n&gt; And, to your stupid example, no: that's not a real example to what we're talking about. \"Gig-economy\" and \"Fake news\" are not both technical terms-- and they would never be used the same way.\n\n\"Fake news\" and \"gig economy\" are both just new phrases that represent new concepts.  \n\nLet's give some example of a phrase vs. a talking point.\n\n* \"Uber is a prototypical gig economy employer.\"\n* \"Pizzagate is a prototypical fake news story.'\n\n**These are not talking points.**  Well, I guess unless you want to argue that *pizzagate is real*.  Please go ahead if that is the case.  Though that still wouldn't make it a talking point.  But I'd like to read how you think it is real.  That would be fun.\n\n\n* \"The unemployment numbers don't tell the whole truth because the jobs added under Obama were part of the gig economy; low pay, no benefits and not reliable long term.\"\n* \"Trump's election to president was due to the proliferation of fake news on social media leading to misinformed voters.\"\n\nCalling these talking points is a stretch because we're missing the ingredient of visibility/coverage and/or coming from something or someone that carries weight.  The first two are just using the phrase.  These second two are also using the phrase but trying to sway you.  If I were in a position to get these \"out there\" I think calling them talking points would be spot on.  \n\n&gt; I don't know why you will not acknowledge this point.\n\nI don't because you don't know the difference between a new, commonly used phrase and a talking point.\n\n&gt; Perhaps it's because you think it has more to do with Trump V Clinton? I think that's probably the case considering that 99% of your political submissions are heavily slanted to that idea. \n\nAnd this probably the root of it.  You are a Trump supporter and hear the phrase \"fake news\" most often used in reference to Trump supporters getting misinformation.  But it is how the phrase is used, not the phrase itself.\n\nAgain, you really shouldn't be calling people dumb."}

It has a format that people tend to follow. \nBut here is what happened at the first debate when the idea of job creation was brought up, Hillary pivoted to climate change. \nHolt asked, ' Let me follow up with Mr. Trump, if you can. You've talked about creating 25 million jobs, and you've promised to bring back millions of jobs for Americans. How are you going to bring back the industries that have left this country for cheaper labor overseas? How, specifically, are you going to tell American manufacturers that you have to come back?'\n\nAnd Donald replied in Donald fashion. Then Hillary was offered her time to comment.\n'Independent experts have looked at what I've proposed and looked at what Donald's proposed, and basically they've said this, that if his tax plan, which would blow up the debt by over $5 trillion and would in some instances disadvantage middle-class families compared to the wealthy, were to go into effect, we would lose 3.5 million jobs and maybe have another recession.\n\nThey've looked at my plans and they've said, OK, if we can do this, and I intend to get it done, we will have 10 million more new jobs, because we will be making investments where we can grow the economy.' She then pivoted to climate change.\n\"Take clean energy. Some country is going to be the clean- energy superpower of the 21st century. Donald thinks that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese. I think it's real.\"\n\nDonald \"I did not. I did not. I do not say that.\"\nHillary \" I think science is real.\"\nDonald \" I do not say that.\"\nHillary \"And I think it's important that we grip this and deal with it, both at home and abroad. And here's what we can do. We can deploy a half a billion more solar panels. We can have enough clean energy to power every home. We can build a new modern electric grid. That's a lot of jobs; that's a lot of new economic activity.\n\nSo I've tried to be very specific about what we can and should do, and I am determined that we're going to get the economy really moving again, building on the progress we've made over the last eight years, but never going back to what got us in trouble in the first place.\"\n\nThat's the first debate where she had to go out of her way to make a point on climate change. \n\nDuring second debate, Anderson Cooper did talk about climate change.\n\nShe said the following. \n\"So I have a comprehensive energy policy, but it really does include fighting climate change, because I think that is a serious problem. And I support moving toward more clean, renewable energy as quickly as we can, because I think we can be the 21st century clean energy superpower and create millions of new jobs and businesses.\n\nBut I also want to be sure that we don\u2019t leave people behind. That\u2019s why I\u2019m the only candidate from the very beginning of this campaign who had a plan to help us revitalize coal country, because those coal miners and their fathers and their grandfathers, they dug that coal out. A lot of them lost their lives. They were injured, but they turned the lights on and they powered their factories. I don\u2019t want to walk away from them. So we\u2019ve got to do something for them. But the price of coal is down worldwide. So we have to look at this comprehensively. And that\u2019s exactly what I have proposed. I hope you will go to HillaryClinton.com and look at my entire policy.\" \n\nShe had just 2 min to stash in some pandering to what she cleary identify as her weakness, and at the same time begging people to go to the fucking website to read. \n\nIn the third debate, Wallace asked her about how her view on the government spending and etc etc would affect America, and she pivoted again to climate change. \n\n\"Well I think the middle class thrives, America thrives. So my plan is based on growing the economy, giving middle class families many more opportunities. I want us to have the biggest jobs program since World War II. Jobs in infrastructure and advanced manufacturing. I think we can compete with high wage countries and I believe we should. \"\n\nHere is the pivot. \n\n\"New jobs in clean energy. Not only to fight climate change, which is a serious problem but to create new opportunities and new businesses. I want us to do more to help small business, that\u2019s where two-thirds of the new jobs are going to come from. \"\n\nSo again, it wasn't like she is ignoring the issue, but she can only do so much if the moderator is asking the wrong questions. She has to address the issues that were raised, and she has to kind of shore up on some of the white working class support, so she did the best she could have done in my opinion. \n\nAnd don't fucking pretend there wasn't talk of policy. There were simply more character attacks. Were the Clinton camps lazy in deflection on these character attacks whenever someone say 'but email' or 'bengazi' or 'pay to play?' Sure, but media was shoving these shit out because people were eating these shit in."}

In fact, it has now reached the point that the idea even being left alive at all in the minds of anyone, makes it a good candidate as an extra in The Walking Dead.\n\nSurveying the data, we\u2019ll start with Wall Street bonuses versus the economic multiplier effects of higher velocity money, go on to economic growth research in relation to distributional inequality, and end with what we know from global cash transfer evidence and the economic effects of billionaires.

But there are a lot of people who don't want to deal with a kiosk or automated checkout lanes and until everyone in a specific industry adopts it, people will take their business elsewhere.\n\nIf Burger King keeps cashiers while McDonalds goes completely automated for its front end, sales will drop as people will go elsewhere. There are a lot of people that don't trust technology.\n\nWhen you are talking about a factory worker it's entirely different.\n\n1-A person isn't handing over credit card information to a factory\n2-Jobs at a factory are often a single, repeatable task. Cashiers don't just stand at the register twiddling their thumbs when it is slow and if you get rid of cashiers, someone else needs to come in and do that other work like keeping condiments stocked or floors mopped.\n3-Other automation in the service industry (such as cooks) needs far more advancements because of the cleanliness required of cooking spaces as well as the ability to handle custom/special orders as well as the proper real-estate/space required to accomplish this and if your machine breaks down, you get $0 sales until it is fixed whereas if a fast food worker calls in sick, someone else can take their place or you can call someone in.\n\nFull automation that is going to cause mass unemployment is just not going to happen in the customer service industry.

That's not a vast amount of jobs coming back to the US.  Will be even fewer as our techology and productivity increase.  In addition, the US doesn't have the capacity, infrastructure and raw materials to gear up for mass production of new products nearly as quickly as china... they have tens of thousands of employees available to start immediate manufacturing of new products.  There is no way the US can compete in this regard.\n\nAnd, China has all the raw materials at the ready... we don't.  They probably won't be big on sharing if we start imposing major tariffs on their goods so we can take away the jobs of their people.\n\nNot to mention, they'll maim our agricultural sector.

Most of Iberia wouldn't have been considered for most of the middle ages, since it was mainly ruled by Muslims. Poland was definitely considered part of Christendom ever since their conversion to Catholicism, claims of paganism by the Teutonic order not withstanding. Scandinavia would also have been considered Christendom after its conversions. \n\nRussia is the odd one out though. It was considered Christendom by the Byzantines, but not many others. Part of the problem is that Russia wasn't really a thing back then. There were the principalities of Kievan Rus, then later Muscovy and Novgorod, but quite a bit of Russia's medieval history was spent as tributary states of the Golden Horde. They would later be invaded by both the Teutonic Order during the Northern Crusade. If you've never heard about the Battle of the Ice, I'd suggest looking it up, it's interesting stuff."}

{"con": 0, "txt": "&gt;The NRA helped Bernie elected to Congress. Rigging deals for self-interest? Bernie made a deal with the Democratic leadership to avoid Democratic challengers. That was surely out of self-interest.\n\nThe NRA? Nonsense. They gave Bernie an 'F' rating for most of his time in congress. I honestly can't tell if you are joking with this post, because Bernie is one of the poorest Senators and has fought so fucking hard for so fucking long against 'the system' that it's hard to see how anyone not playing a core role in 'the system' could ever hate him. \n\nThere's this delusion that the GOP could have torn him down. Nonsense. The GOP establishment couldn't even tear *Trump* down. Going up against Bernie, they'd be *toast*.\n\n&gt;So to say Bernie's an outsider because he advocates Socialist-esque policies during a time of extreme wealthy inequality is silly. This is the best time to do it, because everyone agrees that someone, somewhere, is responsible for their misfortune. Communist Revolutions don't happen when things are peachy keen, they happen when the poor are fucked and angry. Since the Great Recession, that's been the case. \n\nBernie wasn't advocating for anything of the sort. His policies were pretty gosh darn moderate by, say, Canadian standards, it's just that US politicians are currently so far the to the right they think they can get away with painting anything vaguely centerist as 'communism'.\n\nFurthermore, Bernie has been saying exactly the same things for the past *30 years*. It was *Hillary* who tacked to the left once Bernie's sudden success changed the political weather. \n\nI read Hillary's policies and thought they were pretty solid. I also saw there was no way in hell she was going to be able to sell them to the public, who not only couldn't understand them but had been primed six ways from Sunday to believe she'd find a way to protect the 'status quo', however bad they believed the status quo to be. The problem with Hillary's supporters, I think, was that they had come to think that the status quo was 'getting better' for everyone, not just themselves, which (a) wasn't true, and (b) was *perceived* by many to be the exact opposite of true. \n\nAnd yes, the primaries made Hillary look much worse, but that was at least as much because of how her campaign decided to fight (condemning Bernie as an 'outsider' and subtly reminding everyone in the establishment how much better it was to be an 'insider') as it was because Bernie made her look bad by condemning her as an 'insider' and reminding the people just how badly the Washington insiders have treated the *rest* of America for the past 30 years. So it wasn't like he made it easy for them to fall on their swords, but in retrospect, they should have."}

That enormous division has logical reasons for existing, and i think coincidentally they have to do with logic. 87 percent are independent or democrats. Now, don't think im saying this has to do with IQ or intelligence, because i dont believe it does. I think it has a lot to do with the general attitudes of Republicans, *especially* intensely conservative republicans who dismiss facts if it doesn't fit their narrative, usually lean towards preferring authoritarianism and faith over open discussion and logic. I also believe that Republicans emphasis on laws, institutions, customs and religion is valuable to our society, as those are the things that hold it together, but i think its gotten to a point where defending those values has gotten so extreme and reactionary that having an open mind to the other side is nearly impossible.

My ex-father-in-law employed around 100 illegal immigrants from Mexico primarily, during the Bush years.\n\nThese immigrants knew how to work the system. They MADE PLANS to be deported. Indeed. They planned for holidays like Christmas, Cinco de Mayo and so on. They would get themselves deported. I don't know how. But it was like a clock. They did this to get a free trip home to visit with family and friends while celebrating the holiday, a graduation, whatever the event was.\n\nThree months later, they were back in Omaha. And put back to work by an employer who knew exactly what he was doing. And was profiting from this. He named one English speaking immigrant the Crew Boss, so that man could explain to him the schedule for 'vacations' and help him find replacement workers. My ex dad in law paid them ALL under the table and made a gigantic profit in doing so.\n\nDad in law built his multimillion dollar dream house at age 45. He also was a major contributor to governors and senators from Nebraska. Including Ricketts, Johanns, and Heineman.\n\n\n2-TWO. An example of the damage done by these raids: A small community in Postville, Iowa was raided. 400 immigrants were arrested and hauled off in a surprise sting operation.\n\nDue to the raid, the meat plant could no longer function. It tried to find replacements but the only people willing to do the work, immigrants, were afraid of being arrested as well. They did not apply for those jobs after the raid.\n\nAs a consequence, the packing plant closed. The company declared bankruptcy, and the population of this town dropped by 40% (iirc) within a year. The town has not recovered since then.\n\nReading: \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postville_raid\n\nAnd [here](https://thinkprogress.org/how-the-postville-immigration-raid-has-changed-deportation-proceedings-36cee92c151e#.jvowoldl7)\n\nI am all for going after the 'bad guys.'\n\nBut the not so bad, or even good guys: Those are the people who are harvesting oranges and strawberries here in Florida. And tomatoes in Cali. And wheat across the Midwest. And apples in other states. Jobs no one else wants.\n\nSeriously, will YOU take a job that pays 10 dollars an hour in a slaughterhouse? Or a job that has you tearing up the flesh on your arms from morning until sundown to pluck apples?\n\nThere is value in these people and we are on the verge of hunting down the very people our food supply depends on."}

{"con": 0, "txt": "Thank you for the powerful and moving explanation but I would like to pose an open ended question/response:\n\nDoesn't this explanation open up for people to then criticize black folks who DO know their heritage? \"Why don't you celebrate Kenyan pride instead of Black pride?\"\n\nLets fast forward a large amount of time, 500 years for instance, to when black americans ARE able to trace their heritage back a fair amount of time. If one were so inclined they could apply part of this explanation's logic and say \"wow can't you give up the black pride because you should have american pride since you lived here so long.\"\n\nSo my argument is that, with very specific regards to why white nationalism is bad, it doesn't matter if black folks know where they came from. No matter how far they can trace their ancestors back or how much they were able to assimilate their heritage into their identity, if they come to the United States of America they will be targeted simply because of their skin color. Targeted by police, targeted by institutionalized racism, targeted by a teenagers repeating what they learned from their parents, the list goes on...\n\nSo in America, the way I see it, White vs Black is not about one side versus the other. It is about white americans who made a conscious decision to define people by the color of their skin, in hopes of and for the express purpose of exploiting the other race for their own benefit.\n\nAs a white person, if you opt into your side of this conversation, you are opting into slavery, segregation, scientific racism. You are opting into that entire line of thought because of the origin of the conversation. I feel that the context and the history is completely lost on white nationalists. They look at the conversation as having appeared spontaneously. As if it were simply defined by their own life experiences."}

I agree with Greenwald that PropOrNot is a questionable source and their blacklist is nonsense, but WaPo discussed them in that article as one of many sources *and* gave the reader enough information to understand that PropOrNot is the source the blacklist should be attributed to and actually linked to the PropOrNot report in the article once it came out, allowing a skeptical reader (like Greenwald or yourself) to follow up and make up their mind about what aspects of the article seem relevant and whether or not the general conclusions of the article still seem valid even if they don't support the use of PropOrNot as a source.

I strongly disliked him long before he ever ran for office. \n\nThe point is that if you cannot learn to control yourself, and conduct yourself in a manner that doesn't get you in trouble for \"locker room talk\" on the national stage then maybe you are not fit to lead. Especially if you are 70 years old and should know better.\n\nI was willing to give it a pass, though. As disgusting as it is I was going to let it slide, because people make mistakes.\n\nNow, daily, I am seeing his rants on Twitter. His outbursts, and blatant misinformation he posts to social media, and it's just an affirmation of what I already felt. This man is not fit to lead the nation. \n\nHe has no self-control and thin skin. His outbursts show his weakness. \n\nI know a bunch of people will now throw in, \"But Hillary!\"... \n\nHillary did not get elected. This man did. People have every right to hold the elected President to a higher standard, and it is the responsibility of the people to voice dissent when they feel that their voice is not being heard. \n\nRegardless if you personally think they are all just whiney liberals, or not they are American citizens that do not feel that Trump supports their best interests. What I find amusing is that the same people calling them cry babies now are the ones who were throwing fits and crying for the 8 years Obama was President. \n\nThe knife cuts both ways.\n\nDo I count myself among them? Personally, I think the entire system is a sham and should be scrapped right down to the foundation."}

{"con": 0, "txt": "You again massively underestimate Trump.  His plan is actually quite brilliant, and here is a summary:\n\nHe will appoint a bunch of right-wing, bat shit crazies to his cabinet.  They will go about systematically dismantling the welfare state, reducing taxes on the rich, gutting regulations, etc. It will be an all out assault on normal Americans for the benefit of the 1%.\n\nHOWEVER... Trump will occasionally, and  in a very high profile way, oppose what they are doing.  He will pick spots to personally intervene to reign in their excess.  The result will be that the extremists will get 95% of what they want.  But Trump will look like a populist, trying to help the poor and middle class.\n\nJust look at what happened with the plant in Indiana.  He personally stopped them from leaving.  He saved thousands of jobs!  That's populism 101.  But he did it by personally intervening, and giving special conditions.  \n\nThe signal is clear:  only our Great Leader Donald Trump can save you.  So if you want to be saved, you must catch his attention, you must get him involved.  The people around him will try to stop you, but you must persist, because only He can save us.  \n\nEnd result?  Laws and regulations that continue to benefit the 1% at the expense of the rest of us.  But one-off interventions from time to time that ensure Trump keeps his populist credentials.\n\nJust watch how this theme develops with the press in the coming months:  \"Will President Trump reign in the extremists in his party?\"  He will be portrayed as the only hope for us all within the government that he, himself, created!  It's a brilliant master stroke, because few people believe Trump is a right-wing extremist. \n\nFinal point:  I still blame the Democrats for this.  Obama, especially.  They have done little to systematically help the working class.  They are in bed with their big donors, most of whom come from the Financial Industry.  What have they done for the little guy?  How many times did Obama use the bully pulpit to personally stop a company from moving jobs overseas?  Exactly, never.   Just a bunch of whining that their hands were tied because of the big, bad Republicans.  \n\nSo now watch Trump play the game like a pro.  He is our new Stalin, the man of steel that who can save our jobs, so long as he hears our cries for help."}

Their husbands keep FOX news on in the background while they make dinner in their McMansions and they have forgotten what it's like to have their own interests unsponsored for such a long amount of time that when election time comes they will vote for whoever hubby wants. They think they are making an informed decision when in reality they have been brainwashed into such a slow, cognizant desecent that they really think they are voting for their own interests so they can go to their Zumba classes and talk about what brand of wine is best with their shitty, fake, dead inside friends and know that they'll have the comfort of their white, bored, over worked, underfucked, bitter husbands to support them because it's more comfortable than to be a woman that can actually stand on her own two feet."}

{"con": 0, "txt": "That's not true. Numerous studies have been done that have shown the opposite. People tend to stick to the party they voted for in their first election throughout their entire lives. \n\nIf you actually break out the Silent+Boomer votes since they started voting, they have only given 50%+ of their votes to a Democrat once, to Jimmy Carter by about 51/49. Bill Clinton got a plurality, but something like 55-60% of Silents+Boomers voted either Republican or for Perot. In all other elections, they've voted Republican, often overwhelmingly.\n\nThe Boomers being a left wing generation is a myth. Their left wing parents put a lot of their left wing kids on TV back in the 60s, but once they turned 21 and were old enough to vote, they voted way more right wing than their parents ever did.\n\nWe've seen this country drift more and more right as the FDR generation has died off. Now that the older part of the Eisenhower/Reagan generation are dying off, voters born between the late 1920s and late 1960s, the country is drifting back to the left.\n\nThe only way this trend is going to reverse is if a Republican (Trump?) president becomes a success or a Democratic president proves to be a disaster. Because twenty years of Bush/Obama/Trump, if Trump is awful, is going to really suck when this generation hits their forties and fifties and their right-leaning parents die off. The Republican Party is simply not attracting nearly as many new voters as the Democrats."}

As governor of MA, he was a centrist. As a presidential candidate, he was a corporate-first, Paul Ryan Republican. Now? He's willing to prop up Trump in exchange for access to power. He is all ambition and at the moment that means that he'd be no less of a rubber stamp for the Republican congress than Trump will be (Trump, I think, has no interest in getting his hands dirty. He will take the path of least resistance, which means signing the bills Congress sends him). Romney's skill is in making the intolerable and far Right extremism that currently runs his party *seem* palatable/reasonable. He's a much better gaslighter than Trump (which is I think why Trump seems so willing to take the immediate political hit with his base by considering him for SOS). With Trump, everybody knows what we are getting. Eventually, people will turn away from it I think. Romney could stretch this shit out far longer.\n\nI was never one of those Bernie-or-busters crying that we should let Trump burn things down.

The reality was that even though people call the President the \"most powerful man in the world\" he still has to operate within the political system.

Their corporate culture is one of trying to cut as many employee benefits as possible.  It's one of their unspoken core tenets as a company.  I wouldn't say that makes their employees individually less valuable because their executives want to save money and live better.  I look at the service and manufacturing industries as being somewhat similar in that they're relatively easy jobs requiring very little thinking at the lowest level with more and more responsibility as you move through the ranks.\n\n&gt;A service economy of jobs like WalMart and Target with boatloads of outsourced manufacturing can never produce the required conditions for maintaining a strong middle class, it's simply impossible.\n\nThey would need to unionize, just like folks did back in the days when we were a manufacturing economy.\n\nhttp://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americans-dont-miss-manufacturing-they-miss-unions/"}

The US is China's biggest export market and the loss of that market would put China into a deep recession the likes of which modern China has never seen. Of course a trade war would hurt both sides, but it would be much worse for China. \n\nI think quote sums up China's position nicely: \"\"They wouldn't have written the article unless they were concerned\" about Trump, says lawyer Gordon Chang, who is the author of \"The Coming Collapse of China.\"\n\nWhile Trump makes plenty of bone-headed statements let's not pretend that the current trade agreements are working. China continues to manipulate their currency, imposes heavy taxes on imports (while the US allows Chinese goods in without tariffs), and actively sponsors the theft of intellectual property. \n\nChinese goods are only 15% of US imports, while they make up nearly 50% of the trade deficit. From the US perspective, the relationship is fundamentally flawed and changes are needed. I doubt that Trump has an actual plan, but it is worth discussing."}

When they come to the US, they are not coming here to be impoverished. They already lived that life, thats why they're here.\n\nIllegal immigrants that come here are here to give it their all. To sacrifice their bodies to work for shitty wages because its better then dying in some hole in the Mexican country side. The reason they will do anything, even die, to come across our border is because the world they are leaving, and the world they are coming to, is worth dying for.\n\nThey are coming here for their children.

There's been something like 31 convictions since 2000, even though there have been over a billion votes cast in that time. And the scale you'd need to influence an election with voter fraud is astounding. Michigan's off by more than 13 thousand votes. You can't keep that kind of fraud quiet *if you're doing it through voter fraud.* There are simply too many people involved.\n\nElection fraud is likely equally rare, but the dangerous part is that it can cause more damage if it's not caught. On the bright side, you're scrutinizing election officials, poll workers, and campaign staffers and other employees, which is a lot easier to do than every voter in America. On top of it there are \"easy\" ways to prevent election fraud, like having a paper ballot or receipt, using hashes or public/private keys to allow people to verify whether their vote was counted or had issues, having officials from multiple campaigns or independent watchdog groups to watch a polling place for irregularities, having armed security like police at each station, etc. It's simply a matter of whether people want it. I know in Pennsylvania we use voting machines with no permanent record and I hate it, because of the risk of election fraud. I imagine the state doesn't change it because of a lack of willpower, or influence from Diebold (the company that makes the booths)."}

I have no illusions that they wouldn't be built eventually, but the interim time available would provide a party with a relatively clean slate and a real shot at people-first policy advocacy. Plus the people working in a new party have a high probability for being idealistic and more difficult to corrupt. Politicians in the legacy parties are often cynics looking for a pay off or a revolving door.\n\nThis election merely confirmed my suspicion that Americans are still angry and only marginally rational. When given the choice between Giant Douche and Turd Sandwich by the legacy parties, this still persuaded almost no one to look further down the ballot for more palatable options. The outcomes simply serve to point out the massive disservice done to the country by the kingmakers of the RNC and the DNC. These two candidate were both objectively terrible candidates, and they forced them into the general election anyway.\n\nAs it stands, the caucus / primary system gives a tiny portion of the country the standing to thrust their will upon the entire electorate. Sure, people could go join up and fight the battle from within, but the given how that went this election season (particularly for progressives that jumped in for Bernie), I doubt we'll see participation in the legacy parties increase. I hope I'm wrong.\n\nYou're right that the alternative party candidates sucked again this year. What we need is enough popular outcry to pull in a charismatic outsider or two to 3rd parties. People don't want to go do the work themselves yet - Americans spend 4.5 hours a day watching TV. They need a symbol that they can rally behind. That's what Trump is: the awful piece of crap that was still marketed as the best symbol for change this year.\n\nOn the whole, I'm not really hopeful that national-level politics will change until things get much worse. This year is a prime example. So, you're not the only cynic. But I won't recuse myself from the process, because I am constitutionally incapable. So for now I just try to convince others to be open-minded about the options of the so-called protest vote. Any non-voter that I can introduce to the merits of alternative parties is a win in my thin little book."}

Also repression was used because it was not used primarily for GG but also needed to fit the situation with the current political climate which had a lot of newspapers repress (or mute) the news from any side that is not the current main direction of the media (or subreddit), this isn't only conservative vs democrat, but it is even within these groups, for example when Sanders was still running against Clinton, in /r/politics there was muting of news for Clinton, and promotion for news for Sanders. And it is a way how /r/enoughtrumpspam became what it is today, because the trump people brigaded others and pushed all of their own stuff on the front page. \n\nGG was shitty, but that doesn't mean that there was no issue with the ethics, because the ethics would include embargoes, gifts, promotion events, etc. They didn't focus on that at all, and they indeed used it more as a smokescreen. The only thing I said is that the ethics issue was indeed an issue (just one that GG didn't actually care about). \n\nAnd that there were people that had enough of the \"forced diversity\" (I don't think diversity is bad), that their opinions against this forced diversity were ignored or repressed, and they lashed out like this.

The court agrees with me too. They say if life, it outweighs choice - no matter how hard that choice may be. I am sure it is hard, but it is also hard on the child who is killed because of the choice. \n\nI am not legislating a belief, I am legislating based on science. Right now, we legislate based on a belief - the belief that life is at viability. That is what you should argue against. You accept that argument, because it agrees with your own personal point of view. I argue science. We use my argument in environmental law as well. If someone said, \"I have no evidence of how much pollution is too much, so we can only legislate when pollution reaches x%.\" I am sure you would argue with science instead of relying on a judge's personal opinion. My argument is legal and scientific and not a personal belief at all. You (its a hard choice argument) and the judges (we don't know life, so we make an arbitrary point to allow it since we want it) are the one arguing for personal beliefs.\n\nAs for accident children, there are 2 things. One, you assume with an accident child, that the parent's do not want them. I am an accident child and my parents didn't abort me. They tell me how happy they are now for that accident.

This means 1k workers will still have jobs, which means they'll pay income tax, Carrier will pay a pay roll tax, and those employees will have money to support their local economy (which also means they'll pay sales tax).  Let's just do some quick worse-case scenario back-of-the-napkin math here: 1k workers making 30k/year = $30 million annually.  Even if only 5% of that money is funneled into taxes through federal and state income taxes, payroll taxes, and sales taxes (Indiana has a flat 3.3% rate tax on income alone, so 5% is an extremely conservative estimate), we're talking about $1.5 million annually in taxes.  The cost of the tax cuts were estimated to be 700k, or less than 50% of even the most conservative estimate of how much tax revenue this deal will maintain.  \n\nSo again, I don't see how this is a bad deal, regardless of who wrote the article.

{"con": 0, "txt": "States can do what they want, but cutting tax breaks for corporations to bring in jobs never works as well as it should. Let's simplify it. A state will tell a business \"hey. No taxes for the next 5 years. We were gonna tax you 1000 dollars a year, so you'll save 5000\" The plan is to entice them with that and then tax their new 1000 workers a dollar a piece. That right there will make up their 1000 dollars a year right? And the answer is yes, but not really.\n\nSo when you move a company in and they open a 1000 new jobs. Let's say people who are in the state already take up 700 jobs. So cool, 700 dollars. But how many of those people were already working? Probably a good 600 of them, who took the job cuz the the pay increase. So you were already taking a 85 cents from them before. So that's mostly  just moving money from one place to the next with a little extra on top. And then you'll get 300 out of state workers who come in. Most transplants don't change their residency, so that's 300 dollars in taxes you're missing out on.\n\nSo the reality is you've given up 5000 in tax revenue, for 590 new tax revenue. With 1500 of it leaving your state. With 2910 being revenue you were already getting from working residents. \n\nIt's just a bad deal financially for the state. And it banks in the fact that the company won't want to move after 5 years. But if they do act like they're open to moving, that's leverage for them over the state. Cuz now the state doesn't wanna lose jobs, and so they offer to extend the tax break.\n\nThis is why states offering tax breaks to businesses don't really work anymore. Businesses are too agile and are more about their bottom line than providing for a community. What's a better idea is that instead of offer tax breaks, offer state funded employee training for blue collar workers, which might cost you 4-500 a year. As well as offerings scholarships a state instituitions for students to funnel employees into their required fields. This is a better way to incentivize businesses, without leaving yourself dry. Unfortunately most governers in poor states are so desperate to be \"job creators\" that they've leveraged themselves and fucked their states for the future."}

In Russia, it's nothing but legitimate kleptocrats who have built an oligarchy after they grabbed power after the fall of the USSR. They've sold the country to the highest bidder and the Russian people are nothing more than cattle. This is the way its always been but it hasn't changed. \n\n\"Being friends\" with Russia, in the real world, has consequences for all of the smaller Eastern European nations that Russia wants to annex, it has consequences for the many people that do not want to live under Russian rule. Being friends with Russia means handing over to Russia any nation that Russia deems to be its own territory, and letting Russia rebuild the USSR. Not good. The people in Eastern Europe do not want this and I believe their democracy and freedom should also be respected, those countries should not be used as bargaining chips so that the kleptocratic rulers in Russia and America can line their pockets further? The people living in Finland and Estonia should suddenly find themselves member's of Putin's Republic?\n\nFurthermore, this election showed us the cold war isn't over, it's just adapted to the information age. Russia tried very hard to get Trump elected because that is the result that benefits them, they get a malleable pawn to manipulate, who will agree with whatever they say. It's no longer America doing what is best for Americans, it's Russia bossing America around because America has become too weak to fight back or have its own say in things. \n\nWhy should the onus on being peaceful be up to America? Russia is the one trying to annex Eastern European nations, Russia is the one expanding influence in places where its influence does not belong, Russia is the one that is committing ethical and moral crimes against its people (if you think the US government treats its people bad, try living in Russia)... it goes on and on. \n\nIf Russia wanted to be peaceful, they would be the ones to concede with what the West wants. Instead they throw around the threat of war any chance they get... because they don't value their citizens and are willing to draft millions of Russians to go to war for the oligarchs... they don't care about wasting lives. \n\nIn the end, Russia only has one goal in mind. It is not for the bettering of their citizens or the world, but strengthening the elites at the top of the pyramid. They will bring the West down because they know it means propping themselves (and China) up as a superpower. They would love to see America left behind. It's all about power."}

In a universe with a negative unemployment rate, the US could afford to see some jobs be outsourced, so they would not be held hostage to threats of outsourcing (so there would be no hypothetical bluff to the US government for more money in order to keep jobs)."}

It's not.\n\n\n&gt;\"The article doesn't mention anything about the Tenth Amendment or States rights\"\n\nYou didn't ask for rulings for or against your understanding of the 10th amendment. You asked that I supply a link to rulings that support my position that marriage is not a right. That's what I supplied. I later went on to address your interpretation of the 10th amendment. Please read again.\n\n\n&gt;\"I am not a advocate of states right or the fan framers\"\n\nThen please disavow the explicit rights the framers give you. Secondly, if you're not a fan of states rights then you must accept the federal, topdown authoritarian results you receive even when they be contradictory to your personal social/political perspective.\n\n\n&gt;\"As a Christian what if you lived in a state that gay marriage was legal? Your then okay with it simply because you believe in states rights?\"\n\nI addressed that by stating that I have two parts of my personality... one being a Christian and the other a constitutionalist. I'll answer it a different way. As a Christian, I know gay marriage to be not God's intention and as a result I know the Biblical perspective is that it is wrong. As a Christian, my goal is to compel people to have a change of heart and accept God as their savior. That's not done by force. It can't be. A change of heart is a personal decision.\n\nIn the same way, my social and political perspectives doesn't change hearts and minds if an overbearing government forces those perspectives on people. It needs to happen organically. I would assume you agree with that statement, it's important that you also recognize that it's wrong no matter who does it!\n\nFor example, During the term of the current presidency, my government imposed a federal requirement to recognize a deviation of traditional, sacred marriage that runs in complete and total opposition to my theology. Again, it was wrong when that was done. We can't just see it as wrong only when it works against our social/political perspectives.\n\nA state's rights alternative allows each state to be a closer reflection to the will of the people. California for example has a very different outlook to that of... Utah for example. That way of doing things (states rights rather than authoritarianism) runs closer to how Christians operate in winning people over to Christ... by not forcing their perspective. That coincidentally just so happens to support my constitutionalist side as well.\n\nThat perspective comes as a surprise to you solely because you only see the Kim Davis reports through the lense that she was an oppressor when in fact she was the one being oppressed. She wasn't imposing her belief's upon others. She wasn't stopping people from getting married. Rather, they were demanding that she accept THEIR social/political beliefs by force. That's what the whole issue was about... and she was vindicated in court.\n\n\n&gt;\" small government Republican would support same sex marriage, because it immaterial if your spouse is the same sex as you or the opposite, otherwise its not small government because the government shouldn't get involved in your private life especially marriage.\"\n\nYou're saying that from the perspective that same sex marriage doesn't affect me/us. It absolutely does. For example: A federal recognition of Gay marriage means that I con no longer act on conscience and am in turn put out of business if my company believes it can't offer services to gay weddings on religious principals. When you consider that fact, a Federal mandate is the epitome of big government.\n\n\n&gt;\"Top down organizations? All organizations government, business, charity, and even churches are top down hierarchical organizations, do you have a better alternative? (don't answer rhetorical question)\"\n\nIt's important that I answer. State's-rights is not top down.\n\n\n&gt;\"What?\"\n\nYou said, \"Your argument that \"its not their' (there*) isn't valid\". You were referring to Gay marriage being a constitutional right based on the 10th amendment which you mistakenly interpret grants rights retroactively. I'm telling you that you're misinterpreting the 10th amendment. You assume that it was written to grant constitutional rights in an unspecific, unstated, ever-changing fashion based on an ever-changing will of the people. That's simply not the case.\n\nThe \u0093rights referenced in the Ninth Amendment are ONLY those in existence when the Bill of Rights were ratified. I was showing you that by interpreting it as being open-ended as you do, you create the inevitable situation where two parties each having non-specified, constitutional rights run in direct opposition to each other. THAT. CAN. NOT. EVER. BE. ALLOWED. TO. HAPPEN. Constitutional rights are the absolute benchmark for what is acceptable or not. We can't accept a precedent that guarantees zero possibility for reconciliation but that's what you're doing by interpreting the 10th amendment the way you do.\n\n\n&gt;\"If you think this true, then run with it\"\n\nI do. It's why this question begs an answer from you.\n\n\n\n&gt;\"Seriously it doesn't poke a hole in my argument\"\n\nIt does one of two things. It pokes a hole in your argument or it shows your blatant hypocrisy. You're either all-inclusive as you claim to be... or you're not. You can't have it both ways.\n\n\n\n&gt;\"major fallacy of a slippery slope argument.\"\n\nBy bringing up a \"slippery slope\" concern, you assume my issue with gay marriage is that acceptance of one bad thing will lead to other bad things. I can make a case for that argument but that's not what we're talking about. Stop assuming this is my intention. Marriage is between one man and one woman. Your argument is based solely on the premise that this way of thinking is out-dated and that I need to be all-inclusive. I recognize that my acceptance is narrow. I embrace it. I'm just hoping you see that being all-inclusive doesn't JUST mean including gay marriage under the \"marriage\" umbrella. However, if you believe it does and you are restrictive in accepting only certain brands of marriage that you deem acceptable, then you are NOT being all-inclusive AND you're also being hypocritical.\n\n\n\n&gt;\"If you belong to non-denominational church you are a denomination in default only smaller. Non denominational churches usually lean baptist.\"\n\n I don't solely because I don't want those minor differences expressly stated as a requirement to be a member. I feel that observation of minor details as a requirement seems (or at least has the appearance of being) legalistic and something that Jesus spoke against. With that said, if I were forced to pick a denomination, I WOULD probably pick Baptist.\n\n\n\n&gt;\"We live in a world with millions of years of human like culture (stone age) We live in the current world with many people and many religions. Virtually all Christians, like Muslims and Hindu's are born into their faith.\"\n\nI know you're generalizing... saying that we're \"born into it\" because our parents typically will only present the faith that *they* have. That's not being born into it as some faiths actually DO allow for that. The Bible says that each person has to individually accept Jesus as his or her savior and that its not by anything we do (or are a part of) that allows us to be saved by Him.\n\n\n\n&gt;\"I get that but this isn't a war of word counts\"\n\nI'm not regarding it as a competition. Just an expression of courtesy. I interpret your non-response to my questions as having an inability to respond... or finding the need for self-correction after reading my all-too-convincing arguments too difficult to publicly accept, so a response to the few questions I ask is abandoned. That may or may not be correct, but without a response, I'm left to allow my mind to interpret your beliefs as I see fit.\n\n\n\n&gt;\"you tend to go off topic and repeat yourself.\"\n\nIf I do it's only because you do. The vast majority of what I write is a response to YOUR questions and not questions of my own.\n\n\n\n&gt;\"Provide your sources you rally if any supply your sources material.\"\n\nMy argument has been almost entirely from a constitutional perspective. Do you really need me to link to the constitution ever time?"}

{"con": 0, "txt": "Thanks for the response and well said.\n\nWhether Trump is qualified or not is subjective then - but 60 million plus people including myself felt that his business experience as CEO was adequate for the position. However I can see the flip side of this argument, where his lack of experience with law can be an issue especially when dealing with other lawyers.  As an aside I think this is where Pence will show value. That said, I think Obama has a law degree yet he completely bungled the construction of a website.\n\nMy personal opinion, again subjective, is that we have had enough lawyers - that this country has too many laws.  Progress doesn't not necessarily mean expanding the bureaucracy to accommodate the bureaucracy.   I think we have reached a corrective phase with government - in that it needs to be streamlined after growing for 100 years.   Many of the alphabet agencies can be merged and the military has become bloated with middle management.   I think Trump is probably the best person suited to do this. \n\nOr I could be incorrect and he is a total disaster - that said I am remaining optimistic."}

That's just common sense.\n\n&gt;\"Obamacare is a problem!\"\n\nCorrect.\n\n&gt; Fine, there is genuinely fair criticism, both candidates recognized problems with the law.\n\nOh, good.\n\n&gt; Hillary wanted to close loopholes and tackle the underlying cost of care (to make coverage cheaper).\n\n&gt;Donald Trump stuck with the populist opinion. \"Obamacare is a problem!\" But offered no solution.\n\nNow here's where you get bamboozled. They both had a few one liners on the solution. Trump wanted to return competition to the market. Hillary allegedly said what you wrote above. I wasn't paying attention to her plan, so I can't attest to the truth of that. Both of these sound like you might save money. People picked one to agree with based on who they already supported. Nobody really knows what would do the trick.\n\n&gt; it's easier to agree with Trump and not provide an actual solution than agree with Hillary, because it forces the voter to take a stance on the solution\n\nPeople who went with Hillary were saying they trusted Hillary to do whatever it was she decided to do with respect to Healthcare. The same is true for Trump. Neither side was any more or less committed to any specific plan for healthcare. They just decided they trusted their person to do it right.\n\n&gt;which is more susceptible to criticism than the underlying problem. \n\nWell I can tell you this, Trump's side saw a lot of criticism for his \"remove the lines\" idea. This is a solution. Not a full solution with details, but it hints at a direction he'd go in. That direction was criticized. Hillary also, hinted in a direction she wanted to take healthcare. Her direction was criticized as well. \n\nThey both recognized the problem, and hinted at a direction. Ultimately we all chose the person whose judgement we had already determined we trusted more. This brings us to the title of the thread:\n\n&gt;Republicans less supportive of Obamacare repeal since election\n\nGuess why? Because Trump has said, that in his judgment, there are good parts. We all still think it's bad on the whole. We all still trust the judgement we voted for. We all still more or less accept the direction he said he wants to go with healthcare, to the extent that we can understand it. And easiest of all to accept, is that literally ripping healthcare away from millions of people isn't the greatest idea. So we're totally cool with Trump's new approach because our trust in him is why we voted for him. Hence the polling.\n\nI hope I cleared up some of your confusion."}

In theory, this could have a positive effect on the outlook for working class people (automation being an issue though).

Then he would govern from the center left like Hilary would since apparently he's been a Dem for most of his life.

He has so many scandals (didn't even denounce David Duke, I mean, what??) and interest conflicts and has so far considering to appoint so many scummy people to cabinet positions. His potential pick for interior secretary, Forrest Lucas, is against the Humane Society, and has lobbied against animal abuse and cruelty laws! Who does that?? Why support someone like that?? Even if terrible views shouldn't disqualify one from holding an unrelated position in government... I mean, come on.\n\nIf Trump was even close to the person he claimed to be when he started campaigning, that person is long dead.

Sure, you could declare bankruptcy, maybe, there could be restrictions on that now, and I haven't looked into it, but regardless, if you did say bye bye to your credit for 7 years and any hope of starting a future either way.\n\nNow, lets assume you stay on ACA in some for or another, I'll just assume in it's current form. I'll also assume you're living by yourself with a job of 21000/year. So a quote for that plan comes back as:\n\nFirst hit: for 104.68/ month you'll have:\n\n6,400 deductible, but you won't pay for Rx, office visits, and office visits. \n\nNow, of course this will only happen once, if at all, in your lifetime, so yeah it would suck to have to meet that deductible every year, BUT it beats having to pay out-of-pocket expenses each time you go to urgent care, pick up an Rx or, god forbid, another hospital stay.\n\nSecondly, would you rather have to pay the 6K deductible or the total bill? You decide.\n\nThat happens to a lot of people, you're just one of the lucky that this may not have happened to, yet.\n\n\nSources: [Medical Post on Reddit from 2013](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1tugnm/i_never_truly_understood_how_much_healthcare_in/)\n\n\n[ObamaCare Price Quote for BASIC insurance](https://healthnetwork.com/plan/health-insurance/medica-medica-insure-bronze-h-s-a/156526)\n\nEdited for formatting"}

Wyoming has the same number of Senators as California, even though there's more than 66 people in California for every one person in Wyoming.\n\nSenators and Representatives make sure that people in these small, rural states get representation that they have a say in. They're also local elections where everyone's vote counts the same. You vote for your representatives, and it's \"one person, one vote.\" The distribution of these representatives is what gives protection to low population, rural states, but there's still no situation where some people's votes are simply worth different amounts for the same race.\n\nThe Presidential race is the one national race. Every person is voting for the same race. And we've devised a system where people's votes are unequal. \"Why does California get so many votes? I want my vote to count too!\" It does count. In fact, it counts for *more* than those other people. Why does California get so many electoral votes? Because California is over 12% of the population.

{"con": 1, "txt": "Who cares. We don't want california to control the whole election. Every time we hear about the popular vote margin increasing its because california is still counting votes. Consider LA county has more millionairs than there are registered voters in Wyoming. In a popular vote situation you could just pander to the interests of wealthy urbanites (sorry \"educated\") and never have to set foot in a rural state because their whole state's vote has as much weight as the millionairs in LA county. A candidate could run on a platform of sending all trash from urban areas to the midwest and turn the whole place into the worlds largest dump and the rural areas would have fuck all to stop it. The electoral college is a way to give all states some amount of representation. Remember, we are a union of states and the state gets to pick the president. Popular vote gets you your state leadership and your congressional reps.\n\nIll also say, california has one of the largest populations of illegal immigrants in the US. It also has few, if any, protections to keep illegals from voting.

It would be considered outrageous for a person to be billed for being in a car accident for example. I suspect the reason for it is that there is no concept of a social contract in the United States, i.e. between state and society and within society itself. For instance, in exchange for paying taxes we all agree that some of it will be used to treat the sick, in essence, I'm happy for my tax money to be used to provide for your illness and injury because I know you are doing the same for me.

I'm not really sure what your knowledge of the geo-strategy in South Asia and how it applies to the larger Asian context is. \n\nIn one way you are correct, every leader brings their own style to diplomacy and the fact the Trump has his own style is not concerning. But I will come back to that. \n\nMaintaining good relations with Pakistan has been a long term US goal since the independence of Pakistan (1947)across both Republican and Democratic administrations, there has been large amounts of military and non military aid to Pakistan and we continue this to maintain some goodwill. \n\nHowever, even though we supported them, ultimately the Pakistani's have proven to be, in the nicest way, double-crossing bastards, they take our money and funnel it in order to wage jihad as well as conduct largely anti-American propaganda. \n\nIn this setting, the President(doesn't matter whom) has to show the Pakistani's that he is able break their jaw(essentially threaten), without actually doing it, well the best way to accomplish this is to use a proxy, such as India.\n\nBy stating that India has a right to defend itself, Obama has backed off from protecting Pakistan, and has essentially told them that they are in danger of losing American support, but by still giving them aid you also show them that fences can be mended if they come around to the American point of view. \n\nFurthermore, we never know, everything or even most things, this is just the nature of international relations, (because if we did, international politics would not be such a troublesome issue), and even in those situations where we possess the plurality of the information, it's very difficult to engineer solutions. \n\nBack to the Trump conversation, there is strong historical precedent, and I will tell you the tale:\n\nIn the 50's the state department was run by a man named John Foster Dulles, and CIA was run by his brother Allen Dulles; during this time the senior Dulles visited the newly independent countries of India and Pakistan, the Indian's were polite, cordial and followed protocol, the Indian PM Nehru, spoke to Mr. Dulles as he would to an equal, this was taken as a slight by Mr. Dulles(it hurt his ego).\n\nHe then went to Pakistan, where, they wined and dined Mr.Dulles and behaved in a subservient fashion much to his delight. So upon his return to Washington, he plots the strategic mistake of picking Pakistan over India, believing incorrectly that Pakistanis's had a superior army, and superior government and beauracracy,; all of which would prove to be false over the next half century; supporting one over the other. This drives the Indian's slowly into the waiting arms of the USSR. Because what nation can survive against the might USA except the Soviets. \n\nThis whole episode is well understood by contemporary diplomats in both India and USA, so the Indians are very sensitive to American's having a \"special relationship\" on a person level with the Pakistani's. \n\nFinally, you incorrectly blame the left for the criticism of Trump, it was if anything a bipartisan criticism, and the jury is still out about that. \n\nPersonally, my grades are\nReagan A\nGeorge HW Bush B\nBill Clinton B+\nGeorge W. Bush C-\nBarack Obama B\nDonald Trump (TBD)"}

Its not so much the party as that many MANY people find Trump, not only disagreeable, but intolerable. Lets put it this way, there would not be this much vitriol thrown at Jeb because he, on top of being a fairly decent acting person, also has a decent political pedigree (he governed my state, and would very easily have had my vote over Hillary on that alone).\n\nPeople hate Trump, fervently so, and arguably many people should.

Foreign policy isn't completely dictated by 1 person. There is a general consensus of what to do and Trump makes the final decision. People act like he is the only one that will be deciding what actions to take. Also, about the Republican policy thing. He has proven (to his supporters at least) that he will do this with or without the Republicans help. He won the election with the GOP gunning for him so I'm not very worried about him trying to drive GOP policy... about the 2008 financial collapse... &lt; this is why Republicans have such a bad wrap.... Bush might as well have been the anti Christ and he scared millions of people. After that he made a Republican presidency almost impossible due to his shitty decision making. We have faith that Trump will not make the same mistakes due to him not being a puppet to special interest or an institution like the GOP or DNC. \n\nAbout your statement about his inevitable failure... look, he isn't even president yet and is saving thousands of jobs. There is no possible way (if you are a reasonable person) that you could make any negative assessment of what he has done over the last couple of days! This is great fucking news and people are trying to downplay this or spin it into something negative and the stupidity blows my fucking mind. Sanders statement on it blew my fucking mind. Are you to good to say that he is on the right track? He saved a thousand jobs... anyone who thinks that is a bad thing is no thinking clearly.\n\nSanders said that it was bad because it sets a precedent but the thing is is that these companies are leaving due to all the red tape and poor treatment... the government can't stand up to these corporations and make them stay at the same time. If you want a good economy you have to have people work and people can't work if all these companies are taking off to more reasonable countries. Supplying decent paying jobs for Americans is way more important then paying just a bit more in taxes... when you lose a company due to tax increases you lose taxes on the employees and the company.

Companies have shifted operations to other nations to save on labor cost and taxes at a pretty quick rate. Our manufacturing sector has been slowly eaten away over the years as we switch away from industry as the prime driver of our economy. \n\nI'm not saying America isn't a fantastic place to live, just that it's often a lot cheaper and efficient to make products in other countries, and many companies take advantage of that fact. We have a high standard of living and expectation as to what our pay should look like - and that's often quite expensive compared to foreign labor.\n\n&gt;While companies like Budweiser/InBev could have gotten away with it in the past through insane advertising budgets and claiming their are so American, their days are numbered.\n\nThere really is no evidence this is actually true. AB/InBev have lost market share to craft beers, but I don't think they've lost much due to nationalism. Americans like their products cheap, and will often buy the cheap foreign-made products when push comes to shove, as long as the quality of the product is comparable.\n\nThere has always been a push to buy \"Made in the USA\" products, but it hasn't stopped us from spending a ton of money on cheaper, foreign products.\n\n&gt;but to find criticism for a President elect to help keep over 1,000 jobs in the US troubles me. We should ALL be happy for these folks, regardless of which side we're on. \n\nBelieve me, I'm ecstatic that some 1000 or so people will get to keep their jobs. That's huge for those families and that should be good news for everybody across the aisle. But the criticism isn't about the saving of the jobs, it's the method used to do it. It's about thinking what the next 1000 jobs will cost - the next 10000. You can't offer every company threatening to leave with tax incentives, as they will all threaten to leave to get the money. You'll quickly bankrupt the taxpayer that way, and often companies take the money, and then find ways to export the jobs on the sly, and keep their tax breaks. It's not really a sustainable policy as for many companies, the cost savings will be greater than what they can reasonably get in tax incentives."}

In the same breath people will praise Mark Cuban, an outspoken HRC supporter, for his success when he literally is is self admittedly one of the luckiest men alive.\n\nI could be wrong, but I don't think Trump is really in the business of enriching himself. If anything he has less incentive than any president in history to enrich himself, he's already a billionaire. I think this would be a way bigger risk if HRC was elected, she literally became a millionaire from a life of public service and has a foundation with well known links to bribery and corruption, Trump at least got his fortune from business. I'm not sure the logic that makes people think an already rich president will screw America to make himself richer when he sacrificed his reputation and his comfort to attend multiple rallies each day for over a year and now serve as POTUS.\n\nFYI the real risk for insider trading is congress, they are the ones that make the laws, in case you are unaware, and all have massive conflicts of interest. Look no farther than Diane Feinstein (D) and her husband.\n\nOn top of everything else Trump is the oldest president elect ever. Even if he increases his fortune he will die before he can enjoy it and will tarnish his legacy. If Trump just *wanted to get rich* he would have let his kids run the businesses while he sat on an island somewhere and lived out the rest of his days in peace. The only candidate that needed to be president was HRC, it was *her time* and we were *with her*. Trump just knows how broken the system is and wants to give back. If he lost he wouldn't have had an episodic meltdown like Hillary.\n\nI think you misunderstand what I'm saying about the states. The federal government is so susceptible to corruption because they have so much power over all 50 state, the laws they enact affect every single citizen. State governments only impact the laws of a given state. In the current system with power consolidated in D.C., for a person or company to have influence in America all they need to do is control a few senators and representatives. If more power was localized in the states it was be far more difficult to influence the American political landscape because there are far more players involved. It takes a lot more to control state senators from each state than it does to control the 2 senators from that state.\n\nI'm not sure where you're getting your facts from but the federal government has far less scrutiny than states, I really think if you looked at the facts before you commented you would realize you have no basis for that argument. The massive bureaucracy is know to lose billions of dollars in thin air, illegally provide weapons to rebels, run drugs, spy on Americans, spend frivolously with no accountability. Federal institutions are extremely poorly run, just look at the Veteran's affairs deprtment that leaves an answering machine on their suicide hotline or the DoD that pays invoices of millions of dollars for a few nut's and bolts because no one is checking them. It's commonly known that the further removed power is from the people, the more corrupt it becomes, that's not really anything that is argued by anyone with half a brain.\n\nIf you transfer power to the state level it is far easier to hold politicians accountable and it gives people more freedom to create a state the want to live in. If it were up to me states would be able to make their own decisions on marijuana, abortion, gay marriage, entitlement programs, universal healthcare etc. and the federal government would only enforce trade, build a military, and defend the rights set forth in the constitution. If one state had laws you didn't like, you could simply move to another state or replace the officials. Programs and laws that are unpopular with the citizens would be forced to be removed otherwise everyone would leave and there would be no state revenue, the market would dictate everything."}

Meaning they get more and more say as the years go by compared to a state like California that has massive influxes of people moving there. Don't try to recreate a motive to justify the EC. The EC was a protective measure because information about policies and candidates would not be able to spread fast back in the days to allow citizens to be informed voters.

I don\u2019t know enough about it to make judgment call myself, truth be told. But it\u2019s important to understand that everyone is complicit in this. The question we need to be asking is why our culture would rather see a video of Kim Kardashian farting than read an important, 13,000-word investigative article. Do we have to accept that? How can we change it?\n\nWhat\u2019s ironic to see is that there\u2019s an appetite for this kind of change, but people are distracted by juicy, trendy causes. Like /r/PizzaGate. Or more legitimately: Occupy, or protesting Trump, or any of the other major political protests we\u2019ve seen recently. I\u2019m not saying those protests aren\u2019t important, only that we go after the products of our framework as opposed to the framework itself.\n\nThanks to the internet, the ability to spread dangerous critical thinking is easier than ever before. Bernie Sanders was a good step, but we need to be producing people like him as opposed to waiting for them to run for office. Making that happen will take a long time, but it can be done with coherent, sustained organization.\n\n\u201cWhat we might characterize as the failure of the US education system [or the media,] actually represents its successful reproduction of a doctrinal framework that is sustained by the interplay of powerful institutions such as media, academic centers, and corporations, among others. Within this framework, the raising of critical questions, particularly critical questions about the framework itself, is taboo.\u201d\n\n\u2018This hypothesis\u2026 is not allowed to be expressed, and the evidence bearing on it cannot be discussed\u2026 Again, it\u2019s not purposeful censorship. It is just that people don\u2019t get into those powerful institutions for the most part unless the point of view is internalized.\u2019"}

Maybe that's the problem, and maybe that's why the media has been giving Kellyanne Conway bad press lately because they're trying to cut her off from the public, sabotage Trump's administration and get him impeached as soon as possible.  \n\nVirtually no one voted for Jeb! that includes his own brother who voted for Hillary. So the public has resoundingly said NO MORE BUSH--but now at least half the people in Trump's cabinet are Bush monsters.  So maybe Brennan needs to go chat James Comey up and convince the FBI to do its job again. \n\nHere's how politics works, it's a constant battle for who gets to stay on top and who gets to stay in power.

So far he's done very little to reassure minority groups (American Muslims and Latinos in particular) that he cares about the problems they're facing.

Ive also read WashintonPost's article which implied Trump tried to go after the parent company, United Technologies, but couldnt do anything about them because of legalities with their biggest customer, The Pentagon.\n\n\"Defense analysts said that Trump could not legally steer any contracts to United Technologies or punish them through the Pentagon\u2019s highly-regulated acquisition system. The Federal Acquisition Regulations are thousands of pages long and run through an often stifling bureaucracy that determines requirements, puts out requests for proposals from industry, then embarks on a lengthy selection process that can take months, if not years.\n\n\u201cThe Pentagon is United Technologies' biggest customer, but military purchases are tightly controlled by laws and regulations,\u201d said Loren Thompson, a defense consultant at the Lexington Institute, who counts many of the largest contractors as his clients. \u201cIf there is a quid pro quo for keeping jobs in Indiana, it would probably involve a commitment to improve the tax and regulatory environment in which manufacturers operate. Over time, President Trump may secure greater discretion in rewarding companies that do what he wants, but right now the president has relatively little latitude without being accused of favoritism.\u201d\n\n\"Mackenzie Eaglen, a defense analyst at the American Enterprise Institute, said that the acquisition system can\u2019t be used as a bargaining chip: \u201cThe short answer is no, and it would be highly illegal.

{"con": 0, "txt": "Thing is, any evidence against Quinn wouldn't stand up in court, and the rest is, without conclusive evidence (rather than hearsay), hardly admissible either. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof - otherwise, we'd all be getting the Cotton Mather treatment.\n\nLet me give you an example. Legendary games designer Sandy Peterson (we are not worthy, etc.) covered an early version of Doom for his computer games column in Dragon, way back in 1993. His coverage was rather glowing, especially in regards to the shotgun animation, but for everything else too. As well it should, because, of course, this was DOOM.\n\nThe next issue, he announced he was now working for ID, before pointing out that the reason why he had the nerve to plug a game for a company he was employed by was that he wasn't working for them at the time. (Technically speaking, this might have been true, but that's not to say he and ID weren't TALKING about giving him a job beforehand.) No more was said on the matter, and Peterson went on to design some of the most iconic Doom II levels, amongst other things.\n\nNow, if Peterson got the Quinn treatment, we could imagine how it would proceed. He'd be accused of not being honest, of seeking employment at ID by sucking up to them in public, of being economical with the truth, and so on. Embittered acquaintances would go on line and spill the beans about him (or so they would claim), while he would be harassed in his home and wherever else they could strike out at him. His Mormonism would be attacked. He would be abused for being a bit fat. The only reason why Peterson wouldn't get the full blast of the hatebreed is because he was and is a man, and misandry isn't as much fun as raging gynophobia.\n\nBut of course, Peterson didn't have this happen to him. I am of course also being facetious in my example - there is no evidence to suggest Peterson was being dishonest. This happening in the early 90s probably helped too. But then, there is no compelling evidence of Quinn being guilty of anything either. It is just speculation, gossip, and an outbreak of paranoia. It's not really about ethics in games journalism, it's mania and obsession, with a sprinkling of dodgy politics."}

They were offered only $7 million in tax incentives. Why did Carrier take a loss? Because their owner, United Technologies, is a prominent defense contractor. \n\nThe most likely scenario is Carrier thought their government contracts would be in jeopardy under a Trump presidency if they moved manufacturing overseas. So, they took a loss to protect their contracts. \n\nSenator Sanders is stupid, and anyone that takes him seriously (most of /r/politics) are stupid for believing him despite the facts saying otherwise. \n\n-\n\nEDIT: and for the record, I am opposed to this behavior by Trump because this is corporatism (i.e. Economic Fascism) where the power of the government is being used to threaten and prop up select corporations by giving them direct favors through incentives or through legislation.

That's a terrible, terrible fuckin' idea. A system that alienates any significant portion of the country is a bad thing, no matter what portion that is. Population trends and the switch to the service sector for most American lower middle class work ensure that those sticks voters are just going to get more discontent, and having one half of the people who make their laws theoretically represent them more than the other half of the country is a wonderful fig branch. \n\nWhen people feel their interests aren't represented in government, and that the government is unduly punishing them without their say, you get civil unrest. Every time. See: Civil Disobedience and Civil Rights, US Civil War, most mass protests of government action. Half the congress represents the small states, theoretically, and the other half represents every voter equally, theoretically. This keeps the peace, or at least it was intended to."}

{"con": 0, "txt": "&gt;I would love for you to explain how you came to the conclusion that I would declare BLM a terrorist group\n\nSincere apologies, you joined in responding to something I wrote to /u/captaintaint an I had you confused with them. They had described BLM as a terrorist group. Again, apologies, didn't mean to mix you up with them.\n\n&gt; Now, given that it's roughly the same amount of black and whites that are in these types of situations blacks are absolutely not killed more than whites. \n\nAt best that means \"it is justified for cops to kill black people at a higher rate than white people\", not \"cops do not kill black people at a higher rate than white people\".\n\nI'll also diagree that it's justified.\n\nBeing a cop isn't even in the top 10 most dangerous jobs, and of the cops killed on duty most are killed during routine traffic stops because they're struck by cars. The number of cops actually killed, as in deliberately murdered, by criminal suspects every year is minuscule and does not justify the paranoid, militarized, way our police force has been acting.\n\nI also argue that while it is true that black people commit violent crimes at a rate somewhat higher than their share of the population, this does not justify police brutality or a triggerhappy attitude on the part of the police.\n\nI'll further note that the deaths BLM protests are generally pretty egregious examples of cops being murderous to completely innocent people. Tamir Rice was just a kid playing with a toy gun, James Crawford III was just a customer in Wal-Mart, Philando Castile was a totally innocent person driving home, Oscar Grant was just taking the train, etc, etc, etc, and the bodies keep piling up.\n\nI just don't see how a somewhat higher crime rate justifies the more frequent killed by cops rate.\n\nFurthermore, I can link to many cases where cops responded to armed, dangerous, white people, including white people who were literally shooting at the cops with real guns, with restraint, calmness, and deescalation resulting in a live arrest. I'd like cops to treat black people with the same care they treat white people.\n\nAnd no, that doesn't mean I think the cops are literally Klan and just out to kill black people. But I do think it means cops see white people as people, sometimes dangerous or unsafe people but as people, while cops see black people as threats."}

{"con": 0, "txt": "&gt; Yup, and your latter point is my precise critique of accerlationism.\n\nFunnily enough, *my* critique of accelerationism goes further.\n\nIn my view, accelerationism all kinda based on the \"pendulum\" thinking (which I think is childish garbage peddled by self-righteous reactionaries anyway). You start with the pendulum leaning the way you want it to go, but instead of heaving it to where you want it and locking it there, you push it hard as fuck in the opposite direction thinking it'll comes hauling ass back to you and you can then lock/tie/hold/whatever it in place. The thing accelerationists don't think about is that there's a guy on the *other* side waiting to grab the pendulum and lock/tie/hold it over there. And if that guy over there is a rabid authoritarian with an effective means of holding the pendulum in place, then you're fucked for decades or even centuries; that pendulum isn't gonna come rushing back, it's gonna sit there, and you're gonna suffer.\n\nTo unpack the metaphor, the problem with accelerationism is that it requires that authoritarians be ineffective; it requires that the authoritarian on the other side of the spectrum--the ideology the accelerationist is hoping to incite reaction against--be effective enough to incite a desire for change, but not effective enough to prevent change. As you can probably gather, that's a fuckin' delicate balance that the authoritarian in question has no interest in holding. History is *littered* with successful authoritarians; I'd throw out a layman's guestimate and say that for every democracy or republic or &lt;insert vaguely people-respecting governmental system here&gt;, there've been a dozen-*thousand* authoritarian regimes.\n\nAnd, of course, all of this is before we acknowledge the fact that the whole motive for the reaction to the autoritarian that the accelerationist is *hoping for* is that the authoritarian *fucking harms people.* **Being an accelerationist requires you to desire harm upon innocents.** There's no two ways about that.\n\nThe metaphor *I* use for accelerationism is this: imagine we're all in a burning building trying to escape. We're all walking--progressing if you will--in an orderly fashion towards the door, and it *at least looks* like we'll all make it *okay*. Then suddenly someone (usually around the middle or front of the crowd) says \"Hey, maybe we should stop, wait for the fire to catch up to us, and then use the screams of the dying as inspiration to sprint at top speed from the building,\" this person is the accelerationist, full of optomism that the fire, while spreading to the back of the crowd, won't compromise the building above, below, or ahead of them, and full of reckless callousness towards the people at the backmost of the crowd. Of course any moderately rational person would say to this perseon \"Fuck you, you're a monster; keep walking so I can kick your ass when we're all safe outside.\""}

But I have a question about how you think about the Electoral College. \n\nImagine an election where the winning candidate only gets 25%of the vote, getting 0 votes in many states, but carries enough overrepresented states by small margins, and therefore becomes the winner through the EC. Is that a good outcome? I don't mean legal, I know that's the legal outcome. But is it the kind of system you want your government to have?\n\nIf you, like me, think that a system that gives an election to someone who lost the popular vote by 50% is fundamentally flawed, at what point does it become okay? Is it okay for a candidate to win while losing the popular vote by 10%? 2%? 0.5%? \n\nI'm of the opinion that the EC can only do one of two things: not fuck things up, by being in alignment with the will of the people by way of every person having an equal vote. Or it can fuck things up, by going against the will of the people. And in that sense, the EC has only ever favored the Republicans over the Democrats. \n\nBut thats just my way of looking at the world. I'd like to hear it if you disagree"}

{"con": 0, "txt": "&gt; but isn't he an outspoken critic of the Iran deal and someone who views them as America's greatest threat\n\nI have my own opinion on Iran (having spent 7 years in the intelligence community and 2 of those years in Iraq dealing with Iranian-backed militias) but I would say, on its face, that you should no more believe the director of the CIA than you should Mattis. Mattis is an exceptionally intelligent, well-read individual who commanded CENTCOM for ~3 years and understands Iran better than me, you, and anyone you know. If he is hawkish on Iran, it warrants listening to.\n\nEdit: Also, some context for his hatred for Iran:\n\n&gt;He came away from that job with a deeply-held belief that Iran\u2019s support for Shia militias in Iraq meant that Tehran was directly responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American troops\n\nSince the above is absolutely, undoubtedly true - can you kind of understand his distaste for the state if it does extend beyond the pure geopolitical stability issue? They killed hundreds of people that he would consider to be his brothers and sons.\n\nBut more importantly, on this point:\n\n&gt;The retired general gave a detailed description of his thinking about Iran during an April speech at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a centrist Washington think tank.\n\n&gt;Mattis told the crowd that he understood the administration\u2019s rationale for striking its landmark nuclear deal with Tehran, and believed that it would successfully delay Iran\u2019s push for a nuclear weapon. But Mattis said the White House had erred by not doing more to stop Iran from providing arms, money, and fighters to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad or shipping large quantities of weaponry into countries like Yemen.\n\nHe believes the Iran nuclear deal was the right choice, but believes that the follow-up is too soft.\n\n&gt;Pentagon insiders say that he rubbed civilian officials the wrong way \u2014 not because he went all \"mad dog,\" which is his public image, and the view at the White House, but rather because he pushed the civilians so hard on considering the second- and third-order consequences of military action against Iran. Some of those questions apparently were uncomfortable. Like, what do you do with Iran once the nuclear issue is resolved and it remains a foe? What do you do if Iran then develops conventional capabilities that could make it hazardous for U.S. Navy ships to operate in the Persian Gulf? He kept saying, \"And then what?\"\n\nSo basically his position was/is \"the Obama administration did not think this thing all the way through but was instead focused on the more short-term political goal of a deal\". Not exactly shocking that the Obama administration went through with it in this manner, but Mattis' view on it is exactly the kind of view you should have as someone like the SecDef who engages in very long-term planning and strategy."}

It may not seem like much consolation, but if people want to change the way our country views them, they may need to be more patient.  The other option is to of course, move elsewhere.  If I am living in an apartment that hates educated veteran minorities, such as myself, I know it is probably in my best interest to move.  I am not going to be a miserable squatter who needs to pull teeth to be accepted; I would much rather go somewhere I am content with birds of the same feather.  I'm not saying gays should move but mostly everyone here is free to go to another state or another country that better represents their respective interests.

{"con": 0, "txt": "I find it funny that everyone is suddenly outraged now. I'll just point out that this tactic is nothing new and has been used every year under the Obama administration. Just in 2012, there were $80+ billion spent on bribes (aka corporate income tax credits and the like). http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/12/01/us/government-incentives.html?_r=1&amp;#MI\n\nDems are outraged about Mike Pence 'bribing' Carrier to keep jobs in the USA. Understandable. Bribes are bad things, right?  But are they really bribes? Only if you are fundamentally against competing against the world to retain jobs. Otherwise, no. In 2012, under Obama, the USA spent $80.4 billion on inducements to corporations for similar deals. Must be just red states doing that, right? No. Indiana is in focus. But let's look at the neighboring Blue State, [Illinois...](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/12/01/us/government-incentives.html?_r=1&amp;#IL) On a per capita basis, Indiana and Illinois spent similar amounts on 'bribes.' $142 vs $117, respectively. What are these for? These tax breaks are incentives for corps to:\n\n1) Move jobs from other states \n\n2) NOT move from others states \n\n3) Stay in the USA\n\nIs this OK?\n\nThat's where YOU decide. I believe that tax breaks to transfer from state to state are corporate welfare, but worthwhile to prevent offshoring. Democrats have been silent on these Corp Tax break deals even though they happen every day... until last night. And I was surprised that they were so 'outraged.' Indiana did a great thing and kept Carrier from offshoring 1000 solid jobs. A mundane deal, perhaps, but Dems expressed bitter opposition. 1000 jobs won't affect the economy. But, in the aggregate, these small deals matter. Also, 1000 families' lives won't be wrecked. 1000 workers not forced to take pay cuts to work in service jobs like Walmart, apply for Food Stamps to live, and fall into the poverty class. A no brainer. Yet Dems, inexplicably, decided that this will add to the deficit and we must get serious about the debt. Isn't this ring-wing stuff the dems were complaining about circa 2011? Dems never opposed deals to prevent outsourcing until Trump got elected. So, we may assume that Dems want to heighten their class war. \n\nThe rationalizations are insane. \n\n- 'Obama stopped 800 jobs per month so this is dumb.'\n\n- 'This is tax evasion.'\n\n- 'Pence bribed Carrier!'\n\nmore rationalizations:\n\n- The jobs will leave anyway \n\n- We should save only Dem jobs \n\n- Fuck them, they voted for Trump \n\nNo compassion. \n\n\nAs for the '1000 isn't 15M!!' crew, Dems also oppose Trump's plan, which is similar to Obama's that created 15M jobs.\n\nAlso, in 2012, [Dems hammered Romney for not stopping the offshoring of 100+ jobs.](http://www.politicususa.com/2012/10/16/romney-stopped-sensatas-outsourcing-china.html) Outrage! What changed?\n\n\nSadly, it seems that Dems falsely resent the working class. They blame them for Trump even though Dems abandoned them so the class warfare heats up. Dems are making Trump's case that he's is, indeed, the working man's voice. You may think that Trump is exploiting it, but then, so hasn't the Dems? And when they calculated that they didn't need the working man's vote anymore, they thought they could ignore it. Surprise! \n\n\n\nAutomation, etc are inevitable yes, but that doesn't mean we should not save the jobs that are already here or create favorable conditions for corporations to repatriate money that is just sitting in offshore bank accounts. This + a plan to transition the workforce is a better, more humane way that will hopefully prevent more families and whole micro-economies from falling into poverty. We're trying to get people from poverty into the middle class, not the other way around. Plus, it's just demoralizing to lose your job, causing increased rates of health issues and drug abuse, especially in areas where 100s of people lose their jobs and the whole city and small businesses are affected bc the micro-economy is halted. Those 100s of lost jobs can affect 1000s more jobs and 1000s of families. \n\n\nI suppose the democratic party is just preparing for '18 and '20, but I wish the criticisms were legitimate ones and not actions that they themselves have done time and again. It's like they're changing the party's core values and doubling down on ignoring the middle class. If their going to focus on anything, it should be tax reform, and if not increasing, at least keeping the same taxes on the 1% while lowering taxes (or increasing benefits) for the lower and middle class. And also treating capital gains income like ordinary income."}

Thus by voting for him you are at least somewhat complicit in that rhetoric and the normalization of that attitude.\n\nI do agree though, given our binary 'Democrats vs. Republicans' system that they aren't necessarily agreeing with those actions.

We are at a crossroads and I'm hoping that both sides become self-aware and enlightened as to what our full potential could be if we rounded our ideals out a bit."}

Or perhaps more specifically, you feel as if because of your skin color, there is an element of reverse racism.  \n\nIn some ways, I agree with your sentiment.  As a white male myself, its frustrating that I feel like my opinion or voice can be disregarded by those when trying to have a conversation about race in this country.  The narrative often follows that you need to allow those POC to have a space to vent their racial or prejudicial grievances without those of the oppressive race in the conversation.  While you might perceive this as marginalizing and labelling you by skin color, I find that this is merely an expression of someone else's cultural or race and airing grievances, which I feel like we should be supportive of.  \n\nYes, it is perfectly okay to be frustrated with being labelled a racist or prejudiced by your skin color. That is not okay. It is still okay to admit that certain institutional history and structure of our country and say \"Yes, the judicial system was set up to hurt those of color more than white people. Yes, that system was created by an oppressive white culture of old.\"  I think it's okay to learn from mistakes and it is okay for those to call out past grievances, but where I think we can both agree is that trying to label all white people as \"part of the problem\" is ONLY a flaw when we those white folks (including myself) try to deny that the systems we have in place are inherently racist."}

{"con": 0, "txt": "It's really my pleasure - I don't get to do much Civil Rights or Con law (I'm a lawyer, mostly practice civil litigation). \n\n&gt;By your own logic we said that the black guy who owns a shop can refuse service to the kkk member because he's not being denied based on his race but his beliefs. Can you not then apply the same logic to a guy who doesn't want to bake a cake for a gay wedding?\n\nSo here's where you're misunderstanding - using the hypothetical scenario, the KKK is not a protected class. \"Beliefs\" itself is not protected; religion is. It's kind of tricky, but once you understand it, it becomes very easy to distinguish. The questions to ask when trying to understand civil rights and discrimination is, \"is this something innate to the person? Can they change this?\" Race, sex, national origin, sexual orientation, and disabilities (and age, but that's *mostly* in employment law) are all things that are innate to a person (religion is the only one I'd argue that's technically a choice, though those that are devout would likely disagree. It is however, innate to those that practice their faith so it falls under protected class). \n\nIf you refused all female KKK members, that would be illegal because you're refusing them because of their sex, not because of the KKK. \n\nThere's actually some interesting case law when it comes to the KKK/white supremacy that basically says (and I'm paraphrasing a lot here) that the KKK is not tied to the identity of a person and therefore refusing to accommodate the KKK is not considered discrimination. \n\n&gt; we know all gay people are gay but not all gay people want to get married.\n\nBy the same logic, we could say that all heterosexual people are straight but not all heterosexual people want to get married. But because you make cakes for hetero weddings, refusing to do so for a same sex wedding is discriminating against them solely for being gay. The way around this would to be to decline to make cakes for **any** weddings.  It's either accommodate all protected classes equally or accommodate none - aka equal protection. \n\n&gt; How is it not his right to say I don't want to support your belief \n\nBecause being gay is not a belief.  Replace \"gay\" with \"inter-racial\" - see what happens there? It's because it's not about the wedding - it's about their sexual orientation. Since the right to marry can't be refused due to sexual orientation, declining to accommodate someone because of their orientation or that of their partner is illegal discrimination. \n\nThe way that the law works is sort of like layers that build off one another. First, we establish if someone is protected under the law (is this innate to them?). Sexual orientation (in 26 states only) is a protected class.  Second, we establish if an accommodation has been refused due to their protected class where it wouldn't otherwise (selling wedding cakes to straight couples, but refusing to sell them to gay couples). \n\n&gt;I feel like this is an unnecessary intervention on governments part and opens business owners up to always looking over their shoulder if they refuse service to someone.\n\nThis is really simple. Refuse any one you want - as long as you're not refusing them *because* of their race, sex, national origin, sexual orientation, or disability.\n\nThe reason our government does this is because we, as a society, have determined that every citizen, regardless their race, sex, national origin, sexual orientation, or disability has equal rights and equal protection under the law and those rights can not be infringed upon because of their race, sex, national origin, sexual orientation, or disability. \n\nThere's also the slippery slope aspect. If we said, \"ok, you can discriminate because of your religion\", we must make that true for ALL religions. That could lead to Muslims being allowed to not serve women or any one else besides Muslims, Christians not serving any one other than Christians, etc. \n\nBut then we can't just say, \"you can discriminate against LGBTQ people only\" because one, that would violate the rights of LGBTQ people and create an undue burden on them in many (and some cases, all aspects) of their lives. Two, since many faiths have no issue with LGBTQ people, that would give certain religions (those that do have issues with them) more rights than others - which is a violation of the first amendment (\"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion\u2026\"). You would then also need to allow those faiths to have an exception under the law."}

Universal basic income or tax incentives (done properly).\n\nThe tax incentives CANNOT be based on \"keeping jobs\" but rather based on \"percentage of corporate income distributed among labor force in America.\" So lets use Carrier as the example. They get a corporate tax break for distributing a larger portion of their corporate holdings among their workers. They can distribute work to other countries, but they are paying more in US corporate taxes for those workers compared to workers in the country. Now they have an incentive to hire Americans instead of offshoring jobs. They are also only given these tax breaks if the workers are paid a certain percentage of the corporation (which is scaled by corporate size). \n\nSo Carrier can A) pay a lot more in US taxes and export jobs, B) pay a lot more to their own workers in America, C) hire more workers, distribute more wealth to their employees, and pay less in taxes. It is entirely up to them. This also takes on a larger issue, the dramatic income inequality gap that stems from corporate leadership making more as a percentage of a laborer's salary than ever before. Then, when this stimulates the middle class, they spend that money. It is top-down trickle-down, where they don't get the benefit of tax breaks if they don't ACTUALLY send that money down. That's the problem with traditional supply side economics, there's no incentive to actually spend more money just because your taxes are low. If your taxes are low BECAUSE you spend more corporate money in wages, that will reinvigorate the middle class.\n\nThe other option is a better long-term solution: Universal Basic Income. Realistically, not all people have a place in a future economy. Skilled labor is getting more and more specialized, but people aren't getting much smarter. Arguably, by continuing to ignore science, we're getting a lot dumber. Eventually automation is going to take EVERY laborious job, then there will be no low-skill positions left. UBI is probably the only solution at that point."}

In return Carrier must spend $16M and are thus - $9M not counting the costs already invested in their plant in Mexico. \n\nSo, looking at the $700k/year cost to tax payers that comes out to be about $875/employee. Assuming these employees make $40k/yr they will pay 3.3% state income tax a year or $1320 each for a net return of about $445 in taxes per employee with a total net gain of $356k.\n\nNow the alternative. Let's assume that not all of the employees can find new jobs and must therefore seek assistance.\u00a0 Let say 43 using IN current unemployment rate of 5.4%. Average yearly benefits come to be about $27k/yr or a cost of\u00a0 aprox $1.2m. The 757 employees assuming they continued to make $40k a year would contribute roughly $1M. When we subtract the support costs that leaves us with a net of - $200k or a total loss of -$556k per year versus Trump's deal.\u00a0 \n\nThus Trump/state is spending $700k/yr but making $1.256M/yr in tax revenue and avoided costs and thus netting $556k/yr in state revenue.\u00a0 Youll notice this ignores taxes on the company and the $4,800 in federal taxes per employee ($3.8M total).

Now I am not against them entirely, but I am against it in the context of a tax holiday and repatriating the profits to do so. \n\nIf you have an idea for a product that you believe has a demand and or it actually does, you can use that idea to get a loan, or otherwise gain capital, either through an angel investor or a venture capitalist. \n\nTaking a company that is already up and running and reducing their tax liability isn't going to do much unless they are already failing, and in that instance it will save jobs.\n\nIn an example you may be trying to show... A company that is ready to bring a new product to market, A tax cut could help finance it, or they could get a loan to finance it. It's not like without a tax cut they would never bring any new products to market. The effect would be minimal at best. \n\nFor a new product to sell... there has to be demand for it. With workers wages shrinking and hours growing, there will be a time and we are close to it now... that something has to give. \n\nThe only real instance where tax cuts to corporations/business, is if it was incredibly burdensome, and or an actual hindrance to them doing business, and we are just not there. Even if they paid the actual rates and didn't use all the loopholes and other deductions they would still be fine and the vast majority would still be insanely profitable."}

It also has strategies for how to change things to move away from extremism.\n\n-----\n\nThe article is quite long, but here are a few interesting snippets:\n\n&gt; As white people, it was our turn to experience the cold shock of discovering that a significant part of our community has been radicalized, sometimes over the Internet, into a form of intolerant extremism that rejects conventional Western values and threatens the integrity of entire countries. That it has so far manifested itself in ballots rather than bombs shouldn\u2019t mask its gravity: Because we are so numerous, our zealots are capable of paralyzing nations.\n&gt;\nWe need to do what we have long told other groups to do when they face an extremism problem: Speak up about it, identify it, try to understand what has happened to so many people like us, find a way to lead them away from extremism.\n\n\n...\n&gt; [Hillbilly Elegy and What\u2019s the Matter With Kansas] note correctly that the white community has come to view mythic \u201celites\u201d as the major threat to them, a view that drove Donald Trump (and other conservative political movements) to win them over. But both books were shown by Mr. Trump's victory to be somewhat misleading. In Mr. Vance\u2019s case, the author himself proved to be much more typical of the Trump movement than the people he chronicled: It was the angry white voters who resent the hillbillies \u2013 people like Burt Weiss \u2013 not the hillbillies themselves, who flocked to the Republican candidate. And contrary to Mr. Frank, the radical turn against racial minorities did not turn out to be a distraction from liberal economics; instead, Mr. Trump packaged protectionist, anti-trade messages with closed-border messages of nativism, making the economic and the ethnic equal parts of a far-right, isolationist agenda that captured the interest of a great many blue-collar and middle-class voters, as long as they were white.\n&gt; \n\n...\n\n&gt; Carol Anderson, a historian at Atlanta\u2019s Emory University who recently published the book-length study, White Rage: The Unspoken Truth of our Racial Divide, sees the turn toward Trumpian extremism as a psychological response among many white people not to any actual loss \u2013 the Drumpf voters are typically more well-off people, who have gained in recent years \u2013 but to a sense of relative loss of influence caused by the increasingly equal status of black and brown Americans.\n&gt; \n&gt; \u201cWhen you\u2019re talking about the angst and anxiety and feeling of being stifled and that kind of despair, what I see is that, as African-Americans advance in this society in terms of gaining their citizenship rights, that there is a wave of what I\u2019ve been calling \u2018white rage,\u2019 which are the movements within legislative bodies and within the judicial sector in terms of policies and laws and rulings that undercut that advancement,\u201d Prof. Anderson said during a panel last month organized by the online publication, Politico.\n&gt; \n&gt; \u201cYou know, if you\u2019ve always been privileged, equality begins to look like oppression,\u201d she said, in what may be the most definitive phrase to describe the crisis of white extremism. \u201cThat\u2019s part of what you\u2019re seeing in terms of the [white] pessimism, particularly when the system gets defined as a zero-sum game \u2013 that you can only gain at somebody else\u2019s loss.\u201d"}

When the leaders of all the other districts get together to discuss how to implement the next ~~culling~~ war, that's where they go.\n\nClose physical proximity to your leaders means more power to influence them. In your Hunger Games analogy, when *the people* eventually stopped accepting their oppression at the hands of their corrupt rulers, they only achieved freedom by bringing the revolution to the physical location where their leaders made decisions.\n\nWhile the oppressive brutality isn't quite as in-your-face as scheduled cullings, the modern dystopia of the USA is similarly run by an incestuous oligarchy maintained by violence and corruption, but it also invades other countries kills millions of people, tortures innocents to death, imprisons 1% of its population, spies on its citizens without warrants and infiltrates and subverts progressive movements to suppress inconvenient political speech.\n\nThink of it this way: it's already been proved that no one in the USA has any influence over government policy except for those wealthy enough to buy it.

She led a crusade against *violent video games* (!?) while violence itself was on a continued downturn.  She called for a \"Manhattan Project\" on encryption, which is like asking for mass prayers against global evil and completely ignores the realities of encryption and pandora's box of abuse that kind of endeavor would seek to enable.\n\n(To be clear, everything above this point is something I, personally objected to concerning Clinton.  It didn't come from an attack or intentionally negative article.  It was what governed my knowledge of her as a politician, independent of any attacks, that just came from her own stated positions on things.)\n\nAnd then there was her reaction to Sanders.  Everything he brought up was unrealistic,  idealistic, daydreamy--until he garnered significant support, at which point she more or less triangulated to subsume nearly all of his talking points.  Those SNL skits where Clinton literally transmogrifies into Sanders were hardly even an exaggeration.  \n\nAnd then there was who her money came from.  Modern politics has been described--illusively, perhaps--as Banks Versus Oil (left and right, respectively) and she was more or less a living embodiment of that.\n\nAnd then her hawkishness.\n\nAnd then she flat-out lied about Snowden's situation and motivations and whistleblower protections, at a time when we should have been focusing on the garbage he unearthed.  Which is especially troubling given how opaque Obama has been despite running on a platform of transparency, and how many whistleblowers he has pursued.\n\n\nI just think it's weird that we pretend that she was invulnerable to criticism from her left.

That would be bad because it would lead to lots of stress in civilian/political life and possibly deaths through proxy wars (or worse).\n\nIn a less doomsday scenario, the US might have to concede its spot as world hegemony in favor of China as the dominating power. China will have a massive economic advantage fairly soon (and kind of already does). The rise of Chinese consumer culture will lead to the creation of more high quality Chinese goods and entertainment, which will then be exported to the US. Expect to see more Chinese made movies (or movies catered directly to China) and a higher amount of students learning Chinese in school.

{"con": 0, "txt": "OK, but that's not true in a lot of states because of the electoral college weighting.  A lot of people keep pointing out that Clinton is up on the popular vote by over 2 million--but she's also up in California by over 3 million, which means that the popular vote difference in California is larger than the entire Clinton lead on Trump, plus every vote that went to Castile and McMullin, OR larger than the Clinton lead on Trump, plus about 90% of the votes for Stein.  Which is great for Clinton, I guess, except that electoral college representation isn't proportional and never will be, because of the two college votes guaranteed each state by the Senate seats.  Meanwhile, if you remove California *alone*, Clinton loses the popular vote by something like 1.2 million votes--which shows in the electoral college, since Trump won thirty states.  *Thirty!*  And each of those states is worth *at least* three points, because of Senate representation being independent of population proportions.  And we *don't* outnumber Republicans in those states, and we *can't* just give 25 states of any size away for free, due to Electoral College weighting."}

Because a tariff is a tax, the government will see increased revenue as imports enter the domestic market. Domestic industries also benefit from a reduction in competition, since import prices are artificially inflated. Unfortunately for consumers - both individual consumers and businesses - higher import prices mean higher prices for goods. If the price of steel is inflated due to tariffs, individual consumers pay more for products using steel, and businesses pay more for steel that they use to make goods. In short, tariffs and trade barriers tend to be pro-producer and anti-consumer.\n\n[Source] (http://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/08/tariff-trade-barrier-basics.asp)\n\nNow, can you actually refute these facts, or is all you have Trumps talking points?"}

{"con": 0, "txt": "What are you talking about billions? \n\nI'm not a Trump supporter but I really don't see how saving 1,000 jobs is a loss of any kind. I don't think people are seeing the big picture with jobs that are staying in the US which means more taxes / money spent here.\nI think it is the opposite where people against Trump are so bitter they rather see jobs lost than him have any sort of victory. Think about what would happen if the deal fell through and all the jobs went to Mexico. Do you think the haters would not complain? They would complain about anything at this point whether it was beneficial or not.\n\nAs someone who spent 12 years working for the IRS I can say this is probably a good thing for the American tax payers. Carrier will get $700/K a year in tax credits which is 0.00079% of the Market Cap. Let's look at The 1,000 people who get paid $60k which is $60 million in Salary which roughly is $16 million that goes to state and Federal Income Tax. Let me ask you, what would happen if they did all business in Mexico? How much taxes would they pay the US then? The Income tax alone is 22x bigger than the tax credit. Next lets look at $43 million in disposable income after taxes that will be spent in the local economy that was going to disappear. Say that half of that $43 million is spent locally (the rest goes to rent/mortgages) so that is $21.5 million and it changes hands 3x in a year with various transactions that's $63 million in the economy that was going to be lost....BTW sales tax on those transactions would be another $1.5 million to the state....So, this deal where Carrier gets $700K a year tax credit gives the state and federal government $18.3 million in tax revenue. I'm not sure where Trump or anyone is paying them billions in to keep 1000 jobs. The renegotiated contract is $9.5 billion in government contracts that are listed as \u201cin progress,\" and those aren't going to change whether Carrier is in the US or in Mexico. I don't see how Carrier getting money for contracts changes anything as the Pentagon has been working with them for some while. \n\nLet's assume that United Technologies receives none of the cost savings it was expecting out of the move and receives no tangible benefits. That's unlikely, but until we know more, we can't rule it out entirely. That's a net impact of $65 million per year, out of $56 billion in revenue.\n\nEven if you look at just the impact on United Technologies' climate, controls, and security business -- of which Carrier is a part -- $65 million pales in comparison to the $2.9 billion in profits the division earned in 2015. On a per-share basis, the impact on United Technologies' earnings would be small: about $0.02 out of an estimated $6.65 in 2017.\n\nIn a best-case scenario, of course, the company would be able to extract significant incentives for sticking around, which would actually improve the company's bottom line. Regardless of any financial impact, though, the company gains other benefits from the deal as well. That includes the good PR it gains for keeping jobs in the U.S., of course.\n\nYou see, it's a good idea for United Technologies to remain on friendly terms with the incoming Trump administration. United Technologies owns aircraft manufacturer Pratt &amp; Whitney, a major U.S. defense contractor. The Pentagon is the company's single largest customer, with fully 10% of United Technologies' 2015 revenue coming from the U.S. federal government.\n\nPratt &amp; Whitney manufactures, among other things, the engines for the troubled F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, engines that have encountered numerous design and technical issues.While it's not clear whether Trump would even be able to find a different supplier -- or consider cancelling the F-35 program altogether -- it clearly benefits United Technologies not to get off on the wrong foot with the Trump administration."}
{"con": 0, "txt": "Sometimes with elections, you can point to one thing and say: \"if that thing were different, then the outcome would have changed\".\n\nThis election, there are about a dozen things. One of the most straightforward is young voters, who preferred Hillary to Trump at very high rates, but many of whom stayed home or voted 3rd party at the polls.\n\nI support protesting Trump, but I was amazed to see that some protesters in Oregon didn't vote. I think this election was a big wake-up call for younger voters, who are accustomed to getting exactly what they want in other areas of life (e.g. everything is customizable and made-to-order). Politics doesn't work like that.\n\nAs a millennial myself, I was dismayed to see the young Bernie-or-busters (I supported him in the primary), the Stein voters, the Johnson voters, etc. If we voted how we felt, but accepted that we had to pick just Hillary or Trump, we'd have a different president right now. Politics is on a fundamental level about figuring out efficient ways to compromise, not about holding out for the ideal.\n\nEven Steve Bannon's idol Lenin knew this\u2014there was revolution in one country, not worldwide (which is what the more literal Marxists at the time wanted)."}

It's like that Dave Chappelle standup where he's talking about getting pulled over with his friend and his buddy just tells the cop, I didn't know I couldn't do that. And when she's let go, she turns to Bill and laughs, I did know I couldn't do that. LOL."}

And people are too hesitant to share opinions if they think they'll be accused of racism or sexism.\n\nWhat this does is discourage open discussion, because someone who has an opinion that isn't \"accepted\" is never persuaded away by someone else, since they must be a bigot and therefore their opinion is invalid.\n\nSo let's say there is a guy who is considering voting for Trump, and he believes in restricting access into the country for muslims. His main reason for this belief is that he is just terrified of ISIS, and inconsiderate of the innocent muslims that won't be allowed in the country. Is that a racist point of view to have? Yeah. But is it racist on the same level as a guy who won't hire someone if they are muslim? No. And he can probably be persuaded away from that belief.

Country B now has Country A's income tax.\n\nIn this case, the optimal solution is for Country B's manufacturing is to move to Country A and continue to sell in Country A for $115 + $1 in income tax to country B.  Country A is now able to collect on Country B's income tax.\n\nScenario C Trump's income tax equalization plan\n\nCountry B is pissed that it's workers are on unemployment and its companies stop paying income tax while Country A has gotten fat on Country B's income tax.  Country B reduces its income tax to 8% and imposes an 8% tariff.  The new net price of widgets in Country B is now $108.  Country B's companies that setup manufacturing and spooled up money to avoid paying income tax now see an opportunity to make goods closer to market, buy widgets and repatriate money.  Country A sees businesses leave with all their cash as soon as the flood gates open and cries foul.  Country B says \"you charged us equalization tax, now we are doing the same to you\""}

I assure you, Michael Phelps has many traits that are superior to mine when it comes to swimming. Is Michael Phelps superior to me at mathematics?

This is to say that there is nothing wrong with being proud of being Aro2220. You can't though, since you're not me. But we can all be equally proud of me. What kind of stupid movement is this?\n\n'Black pride' is race baiting. It baits white people into saying, 'white pride'.

And so on. It's like a bunch of Jews put arm bands of swastikas on and started shouting Heil Jew and a German going, \"uhh, is this really appropriate?\" Everyone knows the history. Everyone knows where it led to. That's why they stopped. So by you doing that, you are repeating history and, obviously, it doesn't go over well. \n\nIf you can't understand how naming your movement, 'jews only', but saying it is welcoming of all people is confusing and passive aggressive then I really can't ever explain why black pride, gay pride, woman pride, etc are all stupid and will never achieve anything other than to gain power through oppression.\n\ntl;dr: two wrongs don't make a right."}

He is also a fierce opponent of abortions, of efforts to combat global warming and even of government regulation of the tobacco industry. The next Transportation Secretary will be veteran Asian-American politician Elaine Chao, who served for eight years as Secretary of Labor under George W. Bush, Chao, who just happens to be married to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, was criticized at the time for lax enforcement of mining regulations, especially after the 2006 disaster at the Sago coal mine in West Virginia, in which 12 miners were killed. Lo and behold, the owner of Sago, who was also criticized at the time for being negligent, was the same Wilbur Ross mentioned above.\n\nFinally, the military-diplomatic complex, which is awaiting Trump\u2019s decisions about his picks for the State and Defense Departments. Appointing someone like Mitt Romney would immediately calm fears about Trump that are widespread in Washington and around the world. It\u2019s not clear yet, however, whether Trump is really considering Romney for the post or simply toying with him to make him worthy of the title \u201cmost pathetic man in America\u201d that was bestowed on him in the Twittersphere this week. Romney, as well as potential candidates such as Senator Bob Corker or General John Kelly or even General David Petraeus - who carries his own baggage because of his criminal conviction for leaking secrets - could balance out the rather unbalanced national security team of National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and his designated deputy, KT McFarland, who, together with Bannon and incoming CIA chief Mike Pompeo, cast the White House as a hotbed of rabid Islamophobics spoiling for a fight with the entire Muslim world.\n\nFlynn was a highly respected army intelligence officer who seems to have gone a bit off the rails in the twilight of his professional career, earning him the title \u201cright wing nutty\u201d from Colin Powell when he served as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, a post from which was sacked. Flynn makes no effort to differentiate between radical jihadist movements and Islam itself, describing the religion as \u201ca malignant cancer\u201d and \u201ca political ideology using religion as camouflage.\u201d His deputy, KT McFarland, who worked in Caspar Weinberger\u2019s Pentagon in the 1980\u2019s and is a Fox News contributor, is a major critic of political correctness and has openly called for discrimination against Muslim. She\u2019s also a bit of a kook: when running for the Senate in 2006 in the GOP primaries in New York, she accused then-Democratic Senator Hillary Clinton of sending helicopters to spy on her bedroom. More recently, she told Fox News that the Chinese were seeking financial leverage over the U.S. in order to force it to cancel the Fourth of July.\n\nFlynn and his intended deputy apparently share Trump\u2019s curious regard for Vladimir Putin. Flynn famously accepted payment from the pro-Kremlin RT television network and then sat at Putin\u2019s table at a gala in Moscow at a time when relations between Washington and Moscow were at their worst. McFarland wrote three years ago that Putin deserved a Nobel Peace Prize for his role in defusing the 2012 crisis that led to the removal of Syria\u2019s chemical weapon stockpile, though she later said it was in jest.\n\nTrump\u2019s wish for an accommodation with Putin could undermine the ambitions of Flynn, McFarland and the intended new head of the CIA, Congressman Mike Pompeo, to \u201cdismantle\u201d the Iran nuclear deal, as Pompeo tweeted ten days after the elections. If they won\u2019t be swayed by the stark warning issued this week by current CIA Director John Brennan, that reneging on the deal would be \u201cthe height of folly\u201d and \u201cdisastrous\u201d for the U.S., they will certainly have to weigh the fact that Trump\u2019s BFF Putin is the beneficiary of billions of dollars worth of Russian sales of military equipment and civilian nuclear facilities to Tehran and that Iran is his ally in the efforts to keep Syria\u2019s Bashar Assad in power.\n\nPompeo does not share the Russophilia of Trump, Flynn and McFarland but he certainly is party to their Islamophobia. In a refrain that will sound familiar to anyone who has heard Israeli politicians in recent years, he has repeatedly equated lack of condemnation by Muslims with active support for terrorist acts. In 2013 he took part in a \u201cDefeat Jihad Summit\u201d hosted by Frank Gaffney, who the Anti-Defamation League describes as a pervasive purveyor of baseless anti-Islamic conspiracy theories. Gaffney has claimed that Obama is a Muslim, that Clinton aide Huma Aberdeen is a terrorist and member of the Muslim Brotherhood and that a sinister plot is afoot to impose Sharia law on America. Mass killer Anders Breivik, who murdered 77 Norwegians in an island near Oslo in 2011 quoted Gaffney\u2019s books and articles extensively.\n\nGaffney, who also served in Weinberger\u2019s Defense Department, was Senator Ted Cruz\u2019s foreign affairs adviser during the elections campaign but was in touch with Trump\u2019s people at the same time. He is thought to have concocted the controversial proposal to ban the entry of all Muslims to America, which has since been amended to including only those coming from \u201cterror stricken countries.\u201d Liberal watchdogs such as the Southern Poverty Law Center portray Gaffney as the most dangerous Islamophobe in America: he has spread his message of hate, among other avenues, through Bannon\u2019s breitbart.com. On December 13, Gaffney\u2019s organization \u201cCenter for Security Policy\u201d will bestow a \u201cFlame of Freedom\u201d Award on Morton Klein, the feisty President of the ultra-right Zionist Organization of America and on Ron Dermer, Israel\u2019s Ambassador to the United States. Dermer, who has refrained from meeting with liberal lobby J-Street, has rejected pleas by liberal organizations not to accept the prize and to refrain from legitimizing  Gaffney. An embassy spokesman said last month that Dermer views the prize as \u201can honor\u201d and appreciates the Gaffney group\u2019s support for a strong and secure Israel.\n\nThe increasing prominence of Gaffney, who rejected claims this week that he would work for the Trump administration, is viewed by many as a symptom of the radical if not racist Islamophobia that will apparently inhabit Trump\u2019s inner circle. Dermer\u2019s insistence on accepting the prize and giving Gaffney what amounts to a kosher certificate on behalf of the Israeli government actually seems appropriate given the Israeli Prime Minister\u2019s election day harangues against hordes of Arab voters flocking to the polls, his efforts this week to accuse Arabs for engaging in \u201carson terrorism\u201d in the wild forest fires that broke out and his coalition\u2019s wish to outlaw the use of loudspeakers for the calls of Muslim muezzins to the mosque. Birds of a feather flock together, as they say, though for some reason it sounds harsher in the Talmud, in Baba Kama tractate, where Rabbi Eliezer says \u201cIt\u2019s not for nothing that the starling comes to the crow, because they are two of a kind.\u201d"}

{"con": 0, "txt": "Well, here's the court case:\n\nhttp://www.ncwd.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/general/Petraeus.pdf\n\nThe plea bargain was pleading guilty to one count of violation under 18 U.S. Code \u00a7 1924 - Unauthorized removal and retention of classified documents or material, which is here: https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1924\n\n&gt;(a) Whoever, being an officer, employee, contractor, or consultant of the United States, and, by virtue of his office, employment, position, or contract, becomes possessed of documents or materials containing classified information of the United States, **knowingly removes such documents or materials without authority and with the intent to retain such documents or materials at an unauthorized location** shall be fined under this title or imprisoned for not more than one year, or both.\n\n&gt;(b) For purposes of this section, the provision of documents and materials to the Congress shall not constitute an offense under subsection (a).\n\n&gt;(c) In this section, the term \u201cclassified information of the United States\u201d means information originated, owned, or possessed by the United States Government concerning the national defense or foreign relations of the United States that has been determined pursuant to law or Executive order to require protection against unauthorized disclosure in the interests of national security.\n\nThis is probably the most softball law in the books for what he did, but I think it fits the crime. The highlighting is by me to show the key part he's prosecuted on. He took those documents with the express purpose of removing them from a secure location and intentionally keeping them elsewhere. He also shared them with someone who was not classified, intentionally, but he was not charged for that as part of the plea deal.\n\nWhen people discuss prosecuting Clinton for gross negligence, they generally are referring to 18 U.S. Code \u00a7 793 - Gathering, transmitting or losing defense information, subsection (f):\n\n&gt;(f) Whoever, being entrusted with or having lawful possession or control of any document, writing, code book, signal book, sketch, photograph, photographic negative, blueprint, plan, map, model, instrument, appliance, note, or information, relating to the national defense, (1) **through gross negligence permits the same to be removed from its proper place of custody or delivered to anyone in violation of his trust, or to be lost, stolen, abstracted, or destroyed,** or (2) having knowledge that the same has been illegally removed from its proper place of custody or delivered to anyone in violation of its trust, or lost, or stolen, abstracted, or destroyed, and fails to make prompt report of such loss, theft, abstraction, or destruction to his superior officer\u2014\n\n&gt;Shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both.\n\nThis is on contrast to the previous law that requires you knowingly move the information: An example of this would be having a secured room for classified information and taking the info out and laying it all over a diner table so you could eat some lunch while working and then leaving it there. You would have to consciously and voluntarily violate the stipulations on classified information.\n\nThis is in contrast to 18 U.S. Code \u00a7 798 - Disclosure of classified information or the section Petraeus was prosecuted under, which (798 (a) here)\n&gt;(a) Whoever **knowingly and willfully** communicates, furnishes, transmits, or otherwise makes available to an unauthorized person, or publishes, or uses in any manner prejudicial to the safety or interest of the United States or for the benefit of any foreign government to the detriment of the United States any classified information\u2014\n\nIf they had evidence that Clinton was knowingly or willingly sending classified information to that email, then she'd have been a dead ring for that law. But they couldn't find any anywhere. And the FBI confirmed, she was never the originator of the classified information so it's even harder to argue it was intentional transmission, [here.](http://democrats.oversight.house.gov/sites/democrats.oversight.house.gov/files/documents/Herring%20to%20JEC%20%208.16.2016.pdf)\n\nSo it's two very different things. They had a lot of precedent to stick a charge to Petraeus, but nothing in the books that suggested an indictment for Clinton, and a whole lot of the exact same thing being punished only administratively, as FBI Director Comey mentions in his press release."}

What information can you add and how much do people want it?\n\nIf someone makes an amazing song, people will pay you for it. There's millionaires who make music. They're great and they do it to make a living.\n\nThere are artists who make amazing livings. Why? Because they're offering things and information to the huge market and people WANT it. \n\nPeople can't expect a living because you can't FORCE people to pay you money simply because you want them to.\n\nAre you actually okay with the scenario of \"Buy my CD I don't care if you like it. I decided to get a degree in music and now you will buy my CD no matter if you want to or not\".\n\nThat's how one makes a living, after all. And why should I pay for someone's living if I do not want what they are offering...?\n\nIf I become an accountant and I am total shit, am I punished for my choice? No. I am just not desired because I do not help people. I don't do anything useful for them and they do not wish to spend their hard earned money on me. Who's fault is that? Mine. I'm the one who's failing to make myself worth hiring. Not them for not choosing me.\n\n&gt;We all love consuming the arts, so why shouldn't the people who produce it for us lead decent lives?\n\nProgrammers, artists, people who make music, etc make great livings when their work is wanted. If you're working for a company and you make a great video game, you're given money, are you not? Are you not being paid for your work there? Is your art, music, and overall game not being bought? Do we not buy music? Do we not buy paintings?\n\n&gt;I love cool tech as much as the next person, but it's not the only metric by which we evaluate how advanced society is.\n\nCertainly, but great artists, visionaries, etc are all well paid. \n\n&gt;First off, I don't agree. There's billions of people on this planet and there's niche markets for all sorts of things.\n\nThen they can't complain about being poor, right? People want what they offer, so they don't have troubles finding clients, jobs, and people wanting to buy their product, right? So by that logic, no one should be whining because there's billions of people and there's a niche market for everything. I'll agree, of course. \n\n&gt;people have value unto themselves. Humans have innate value, because we all mean something to someone (hopefully)\n\nHey, if you want to spend your hard earned money from being in whatever field you are on a person who chose a \"fun\" field in which his shit isn't being purchased, feel free. I'll pass, though. \n\n&gt;It's by fluke we're here at all. We should preserve and cultivate our entire species.\n\nWell we've survived for millions of years by mainly survival of the fittest, and our current system is a lot more lenient than that. But money, the economy, and people aren't rubber bands. Communism doesn't work. If everyone was nice and loving and there was no greed or will to want to go above and beyond then yeah, communism and all this \"love\" stuff could work.

{"con": 0, "txt": "Level of Formal Education isn't directly proportional to personal intelligence. (Likewise, it isn't necessarily proportional to political intelligence, either.) Yes, people with more formal education lean more Blue than Red, but that's not the same as saying they're smarter.\n\nEssentially, your argument is the following:\n\nPremise 1\u2014 People who have formal education are smarter than people without. \nPrecise 2\u2014 People who have formal education more often vote Blue.\nConclusion\u2014 Therefore, smarter people more often vote Blue.\n\nFurthermore,\n\nPremise 3\u2014 Smarter people tend to do smart things.\nPremise 4\u2014 Smarter people more often vote Blue.\nConclusion\u2014 Voting Blue is a smart thing to do. (Hey, it rhymes!)\n\nLogic tells us that if an argument is sound, and its premises are true, its conclusion must also be true. Unfortunately, premise 1 is not true, which makes Premise 4 invalid.\n\nFor example, my mother graduated from high school a year early with honors, and was a first generation college student, also honors. My grandfather had to drop out of elementary school to work on the corn farms in his little New Jersey town to support his (broken) family; meanwhile, my Yai (grandmother) was the oldest of five children in (what was then) a third world nation. Neither of my grandparents received any kind of education any higher to an equivalent of a high-school diploma, nor did they grow up in the ideal economic circumstances that they provided for their children. Yet, whenever I needed help in high school, be it any subject at any level, be it anything from long division to calculus, guess who I would ask for help. Sorry mom, you're great and all, but you were useless as a tutor; she didn't remember anything at all from when she was a student. However, my grandparents, between the two of them, who lacked any higher education, could instantly provide help to me on any subject on any level. My point? Well, aside from bragging about my grans (:P), by necessity of the very definition, they are smarter in those subjects than my mother despite the dramatic difference in formal education.\n\nAnother; (and I'm gonna add a brag warning here) during high school I had the opportunity to take a vocational class in Intro. to Drafting. My instructor would lecture us for half the class on Monday, then give us a week's worth of work for us to complete on our own. And yet, almost every week, I would be finished with the week's assignments\u2026on Monday, leaving me free for whatever for the rest of the week. Once, in my free time, my instructor gave me a challenge; try to hand draft (as the class was 99.9% Computer Aided Design) a perfect five point star. I had virtually no experience in that, but it only took me maybe ten minutes. My instructor told me that although it had been a few years since any of his high school students had successfully done so, I was the first of anyone in his classes to have done it on &lt;I&gt;the first try.&lt;/I&gt; There are people who have professional degrees in this stuff, but if people with formal education are smarter, how could I do a perfect job on my first try with no help whereas others need multiple tries to get it?\n\nNow, you could revise Premise 1 to be more qualitative and say \"people with formal education are sometimes or often smarter than those without,\" but the reality is that personal intelligence is a complicated thing that psychologists have always struggled to accurately measure, and it varies by subject. Ask medical researchers the literary significance of the Horse in Orwell's Animal Farm and they might tell you they're too busy developing a cure for cancer, and you'll see what I mean.\n\nAlso, just because you can't see the wind doesn't mean it doesn't exist. Just because you haven't met many right-leaning intellectuals doesn't mean they are \"extremely lacking\" in number. Confirmation bias is a problem for anyone, regardless of political opinion, so I can see why you might think that. I've found that a lot of right-leaners go unnoticed because they prefer to keep their opinions to themselves unless asked.\n\nTL;DR, having a formal education does not necessitate that you are smart."}

Your angry at people who were not excited about Hillary for not being afraid enough of Trump.  Do you realize how ridiculous that is?  It's like saying \"you're not afraid enough of chocolate to get vanilla\" when all the while they wanted pistachio.\n\nOn a similar note, the DNC has routinely *ignored* the Rust Belt because they've always just written it off as unobtainable and therefore not worth their time.  AND as with the Bernie supporters and the Green party supporters, it's the people of the Rust Belt's vote, they can do with it as they like.  No one is obligated to vote for one of our two bullshit major party's candidates just because they tell them they're less of a nightmare that the other one.  That's not how voting works.\n\nSecond, Comey and his little leak had very little to do with Hillary losing.  It was a bullshit move and I personally hope he gets removed from his office for it but it had a negligible effect on the outcome of the election.  Blaming Comey for Hillary's loss is just childish.  The mainstream media dropping massive predictions of a Hillary landslide are far more to blame than that.\n\nTo that end...\n\nThose \"apathetic dickheads\", as you call them, weren't motivated to vote because, as I said in my comment above, people don't jump out to vote *against* a candidate.  It just isn't enough.  The scare tactics didn't work because so long as the trains run on time people aren't very motivated to go take time from their day or off of work to cast a ballot.  And on that night especially, a huge number of people didn't think they had to.  I voted, but I know a number of people who didn't because \"there's no way Trump will win\" and \"they're predicting a landslide for Hillary so I really don't need to bother\".\n\nThe best thing the DNC can do is embrace Bernie politics and let him lead them to become a stronger more progressive party so that 2 years from now they can rally some voters and finagle a few liberals into the House in areas that the Dems really *should* be strong in but aren't, because they've written those districts and states off for the last 15 years as being too conservative to win.  It's not black and white, it's a very complicated issue that the Democrats have been ignoring for far to long.  It's just ridiculous that working class people voted for a billionaire who has a recorded history of screwing people who have worked for him."}

{"con": 0, "txt": "You cannot compare/contrast communism and fascism quite directly, while definitely on paper the former is an radical left wing form of economic distribution and the latter a reactionary right wing form of government structure and control/idealism they don't properly fall in the same spectrum.\n\nThere is overlap though, they are extremely populist in origin and have origins rooted in worker strength and empowerment to drive popularity for the ideal but fascism trends towards sociocapitalism with an emphasis on military spending while communism is the effective antithesis to capitalism and puts giant heavy shackles on the military industrial complex if not quashing it entirely. Fascism/Capitalism (totalitarianism) states create a gravity well that eventually suck all money and power to the top of the pyramid the theoretical end game being one person controlling all wealth and power in society, whereas Anarchy/Communism represents no one getting ahead but stability of life for everyone and the elimination of rent coinciding with workers controlling the means of production as well.\n\nNeither extreme is healthy because one results in too much power collected in too few people and vast disparities in wealth, the latter gives people no reason to give a shit (something automation could solve in combination with Universal Basic Income) and attempts to impossibly suppress the human individuals will to do better than others within their environment, it is also impossible to achieve completely because a pure state of anarchy and worker control would fall to poor management and/or being overtaken by hostile forces (low military spending if any, a sort of individual militia state before all else) who are organized and well funded.\n\nIt goes without saying that Marxist Communism has never truly existed, because a true communist state is not totalitarian/authoritarian or promoting military expansion, China and the U.S.S.R. ended up looking far more Capitalistic than Communistic long before the former fell and the latter tried to change its image despite retaining the communist name."}

{"con": 0, "txt": "&gt;But we have the same issue with the EC right now. A small handful of states (and it's the same states every cycle) decide the president. So you get pandering to the coal lobby, and the corn farmers, and the same small portion of the country every time. It's no different than you're talking about in Canada.\n\nNo, it's the opposite, the government ignores everyone else, because Toronto, Ottawa, and Montreal decide the election. They're also the largest cities. They don't need to campaign anywhere else, because if they win those three, they win everything, why bother with anything else? (It's a little different than that, and I'm exaggerating a bit, but you get the idea) \n\nThis is akin to how California and New York would decide every election. No one would campaign outside of those states (However, I expand on why this doesn't really matter anyway further down)\n\n&gt;I also think campaigns for a national popular vote wouldn't focus entirely on big cities. They'd have to focus on regions and demographics. Actual populations of people, and not arbitrary district/state boundaries.\n\nThey wouldn't, because so many states vote solely Democrat or solely Republican, to the point where the other party would have to completely change their stance on every issue to get any voters from those states. As stated previously, this would likely mean that no matter what, the Democrats win every election because New York and California decide the vote and they always have and always will vote almost entirely Democrat. Which is fine with you if you're a Democrat I suppose.\n\nIgnoring that fact, why would they bother going to the small states with no votes when they can go to the \"next biggest\" states after the ones that are already pre-decided and campaign there? The midwest wouldn't ever see a politician. Why do you think they would? Their voter density wouldn't be worth anyone's times. \n\n&gt;In either system, one group has more power than the other. So why is the system that gives the power to the smaller group better? It's worse for the average person.\n\nBecause the bigger states have power through other means. Population leads to power, even without the president being \"your guy\". The smaller states might as well not even exist if the system wasn't set up the way it is.\n\nAgain, you wouldn't care about this at all if you lived in New York or California, because changing the system leads to massive benefits to you."}

The majority of the saved jobs, reports indicate, are low payed, high turnover positions which were unlikely to be very profitable to move in the first place. We'll see in time whether these low payed 800 jobs last long enough to pay back the $7M in taxes. As of right now, there is a tax deficit and the precedence that companies can threatened to move to Mexico for free tax breaks. Eventually, you'll have to face the reality that Trump offers no real solutions and the fact that these short term bribes are not sustainable.\n\nBy the way, have you heard about Carrier's parent company role in this decision?

Donald trump is all bark and no bite for everything he says he has no actual evidence and all he is is a rich prattling politician. An example of Trump giving a outrages statement with no real evidence is that Immigrants are taking our jobs. According to Professor McLaren who used U.S census data from 1980 to the year 2000 for every immigrant that enters the U.S 1.2, jobs are created for local residents. Immigrants in the U.S even contribute to 0.5 percent of the U.S GDP that is roughly 83,850,000 dollars that the government can use for healthcare projects and the running of the country.

{"con": 0, "txt": "&gt;  Take the unemployment rate for an example- it is posted by the government as something like 4.9%. That is a fact, but it is a horribly inaccurate fact.\n\nWell... no.  The U3 rate is a fact that is commonly inaccurately used by people who either don't understand or (more rarely) wilfully misrepresent what it actually means.  That doesn't make it any less of a fact, merely a commonly-abused one.\n\nSay the U3 rate goes up.  That's bad, right, meaning that it must be that fewer people have jobs?  Wrong: employment (and the employment rate) can rise at exactly the same time that the unemployment rate rises.  The U3 rate measures the fraction of the labor force that does not have a job, are available to work, and are actively looking for a job; the labor force being defined as these people plus those who do have a job.  So if people who weren't looking for a job because they'd lost hope of finding one were inspired by news of recent hiring to start looking, the unemployment rate can go up.\n\nApart from being misleading as to the current state of the economy, the U3 rate is a lagging indicator: if a downturn begins and business slows down, companies don't start firing people immediately because they've invested lots of expensive training in their current workforce that would be lost if they let people go.  As it becomes clearer that business isn't going to start picking up again soon, then they start shrinking their workforces and the U3 rate shoots up as formerly employed people look for new employment.  If the downturn continues some will give up the job search, curbing the growth of U3.  Then when things start picking up again and companies start hiring once more, the improving chance of employment brings them back to looking for a job again and so the U3 stays stubbornly high despite the improving job figures.  Very roughly.  So the headline unemployment rate is only an approximate indicator of how the economy was doing six months ago, but is commonly uncritically treated as a current indicator.\n\nI've also noticed over the last few years a surprisingly large number of people believing that the U3 headline unemployment rate only counts people who are receiving unemployment insurance benefits, such that unethical state governments can make it look like their states have lower unemployment rates by making it more difficult to claim these.  However, the [definition of unemployment used in coming up with the data](http://www.bls.gov/cps/cps_htgm.htm#unemployed) has nothing to do with receiving UI.  [The BLS explains](http://www.bls.gov/cps/uiclaims.htm).\n\n&gt; The real unemployment rate is statistically significantly different from the published rate, that also is a fact.\n\nAre you thinking of [U4, U5 or U6](http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t15.htm) as the 'real' rate?  If you want to talk about U6, say U6 and refer to its series for historical values, [which are published by the BLS](http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS13327709)."}

There's some indication that such a decision would've been likely, but it's far from certain.\n\nHere's the kicker, though -- neither the Gore nor Bush campaign had any interest in overvotes.  Overvotes were discarded in accordance with Florida policy and never picked back up, and the Bush v Gore lawsuit never made any mention of overvotes either way.\n\nThe only scenario in which Gore could've won is if a recount proceeded, that recount included overvotes in addition to undervotes, and those overvotes were considered in either the \"lenient\" or \"Palm Beach\" standards (where dimples could count).  If the recount proceeded and they used the two-corner or fully-detached standard of counting, Bush still would've won.  \n\nI'm not going to disagree that the Bush v Gore opinion wasn't an atrocious, immoral act of partisan hackery originating from the highest court in the land.

{"con": 0, "txt": "&gt;that need only goes so far\n\nIn regards to that and your first paragraph, I definitely understand where you are coming from. It sucks to have to trust the government.

Unfortunately, it is the best we got.\n\n&gt;conducting domestic espionage an act of war, as the NSA have done?\n\nSo, I realize this probably isn't the best site/group for me to have this debate with. I believe that the NSA collects intelligence, including some domestic data, but makes a good faith effort to avoid accessing data of American citizens. You could argue that this compromise of privacy is not worth the additional security it may provide. That is a tough call for me, but maybe easy for you. I don't think your view on it is irrational. I am sure there are folks who have abused it for personal reasons, but they were (hopefully) all caught and punished. I am not a big fan of the dragnet style government surveillance either, but again, that's not the only stuff that was leaked. If he had only leaked that kind of stuff, he may be able to hold the moral high ground. I saw the documentary where he said he just leaked everything because he didn't want to introduce his own bias. It sure *sounds* admirable, but in reality, it was irresponsible, and I do believe he chose to handle it the wrong way... and in so many ways. \n\nYour last few sentences certainly remind me of all the anti-privacy bills that get passed. We had just passed some this week. There was protest, yet it still happened. The American people don't seem to understand what is at stake here or are just apathetic. When was the last time you saw a major politician running under the platform of protecting the internet or the privacy of Americans?

{"con": 0, "txt": "If you didn't continue to claim that disagreeing with you about the electoral college equates to supporting Trump, I wouldn't claim you think this is a plot against Hillary.\n\nI can analyze the election and the process without injecting my opinion of the candidates themselves.  Pointing out your simplifications, bad assumptions, and distortions doesn't equate to support for Trump.  The only role the candidates play in my analysis of the process of electing the president is that Hillary and Trump as our choices show that the system was irreparably broken before the election ever occurred.  I believe i can safely assert that both historically unpopular candidates were horrible for America.\n\nYou can't seem to manage rational discussion about the system without injecting your political views.  Underlying your obsession with the popular vote is the implied assumption that the selection of choices was done fairly.  But if that selection process is flawed, there is no fix to be applied later.\n\nFurthermore, you even seem to think the boundaries of the states and the Constitution was designed to build an advantage for one political group against another!  Intent and design and execution by a political group to set boundaries to gain political advantage over their opponents is what gerrymandering really means. Obviously nothing like that happened here.  \n\nThe intent of the electoral college was to even representation between states in a union of states to convince said independent states to pool political power into a federation.  Certainly slavery (as others have pointed out)  played a role, but also the fact that when slavary was eliminated, the South's representation in elections was increased, not decreased.  And that power shift helped Democrats historically, not Republicans.\n\nBecause the design bridged the gap between more rural states vs more urban states.\n\nYou might correctly observe that we now have a federation, and with the civil war we have established that states have no power to leave the union.  So perhaps we no longer care about a compromise struck to gain a state's participation in the union.  But states remain interested parties in this debate. \n\nBtw, we see similar voting systems in other unions, such as the United Nations, the European Union, and other federations.  Removing the system should be done carefully, if at all.  My original assertion applies, that too small a group of people in the major parties selects our choices. So fixing the electoral college won't result in better Democracy."}

This was after New Hampshire when Bernie Sanders actually had MORE pledged delegates (if you don't count super delegates, which you shouldn't) than Hillary. Instead of even acknowledging this fact they showed images like this and talked about how Bernie had no chance because of Hillary's insurmountable lead.\n\nAnd then after Super Tuesday and a lot of the earlier States (Where everybody knew Hillary was going to do better than Sanders in since she was getting more support from Black voters), when HIllary actually had built up a solid lead, that's finally when some of them started talking about actual pledged delegates and dropped the super delegates for a time, but kept the narrative of an insurmountable lead. They ignored what all of the analysts were showing in that Bernie had a great chance of getting a lot more votes when it came to western States, and indeed Bernie caught up a lot, but not enough. He actuallyt won something like 10 states in a row with landslide victories, but they were barely even reported upon and the mainstream media kept talking about Hillary's insurmountable lead.\n\nNow we have multiple instances from the e-mails of Hillary's campaign and the DNC working together to push a certain narrative to the Mainstream Media, doesn't take much of a leap to think that they were pushing this \"insurmountable/inevitable lead\" narrative as well."}

At Trump's &lt;37k tax bracket of 12% that's 1.92 mil in tax revenue yearly, or 1.12 mil subtracting the tax break. Carrier will also invest 16 mil in their facilities in America as part of the deal. And those workers, as a result of making probably 30-40k in reality, have to spend most or all of that money, meaning it's being recirculated.\n\nI think the real problem is that he's shown he won't be doing anything more impressive or effective than any politician before him. So all we have is mediocre results at best from him when making business deals with a (comparatively small) corporation despite being backed by the largest economic power. These deals are supposed to be his bread &amp; butter. Instead he's totally average, and has little other relevant experience or skills, and a wealth of questionable ideas/behaviors.\n\nOf course, another way to look at it is Carrier is sending 1300 jobs out of the US and getting subsidies to keep a fraction. However, it's equally arguable the jobs were essentially gone already. Either way this is nothing to celebrate."}

{"con": 0, "txt": "The EC is working horribly differently than designed. Some fundamental things about our country have changed that have completely distorted the functioning of the Electoral College. The founders designed a system where white male landowners were the only voters and that is no longer true. \n\nThe original design was built to entice the south to go along with joining the union. They put in a mechanism so that Virginia, a large slaveowning state with thousands-acre plantations, could count their non-voting slaves as 3/5th of a population for electoral purposes. Otherwise, Virginia, economically powerful and crucial to the success of the Union would not join because their population of white, male, landowners was disproportionally smaller because their plantations were each larger. \n\nNowhere did the design of the electoral college system envision the enfranchisement of blacks or of women. Or even apartment dwellers. Our modern ideals of individual equality are nowhere to be found in the Electoral College design. \n\nAnd that's fucked up.\n\nWorse, from a response to your comment, the protection of the rural say-so doesn't even actually happen. That's a myth. The one last purported benefit doesn't even happen. Doubt me? How many campaign stops did Wyoming get? None. How about Idaho? None. Montana? None. California only got one, which was a fundraiser, but so did Texas. How is the rural vote being courted, again? Red and rural Alabama got just as little campaign love as blue and rural Oregon, which is to say none. \n\nFlorida alone got more campaign events than every state West of the Mississippi. That is a huge swath of rural America that is just as similarly disenfranchised as California. The EC purports to but doesn't actually give rural votes any more electoral sway. In modern practice, the EC actually rewards states for being swing states. In this system if rural voters wanted to affect national elections they are better rewarded by there being a chance that they swing one way or the other. \n\nSince the EC doesn't live up to literally any of it's design goals, maybe it is time we start to rethink it so that every vote from every state matters."}
