# Neural-Network-Classifier
Example of building Neural Network Classifier using different Python libraries like Keras, Scikit learn etc.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisite
To execute this project, you will need the following applications -

* Pythnon 3 (or Anaconda distribution with Python 3)
* Jupyter or any other notebook
* Python libraries: pandas, numpy, json, re, pickle, nltk, sklearn, keras

## Installing
This particular project does not require any installation other than the required softwares mentioned above.

## Usage
In both cases (keras and scikit), the respective data files are too big to upload. Therefore, the data has been reduced to 10000 records in each cases.

## Project Status
Project work in progress and will be constantly updated.

## Versioning
Git is used for project versioning.
